<p>Anyone need a lift to the 2010 Maker Faire? I'll be driving there on Fri. May 21 and driving back on Mon. May 24. I have not yet figured out where I'll be staying while in the Bay Area. Most likely an inexpensive Best Western or Comfort Inn type of place. If more than two people are interested in traveling with me I'll take my SUV which can comfortably seat 6 adults, moderately comfortably seat 8, but 6 is recommended. It has full rear seat entertainment and the ability to power/charge 3 devices. More if someone brings a car power adapter. It's an 11 hour drive so I plan to leave the Portland area at 8:00 AM. A small donation for gas would be helpful for those who can afford it.</p><p>William Bowers</p>
