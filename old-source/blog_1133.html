<p>Here's the beginnings of a circuit for playing with what I think of as power electronics -- particularly inductors and batteries.&nbsp; Design goal is modest voltage (6-25V), modest current (1-5A), modest power (5-10W).&nbsp; I'd like to be able to characterize inductors and transformers, learn about magnetic saturation, and charge &amp; discharge batteries.</p>
