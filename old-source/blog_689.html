<p>A colleague recently suggested I try laser-cutting paper to make solder paste stencils, instead of ordering metal or Kapton stencils. I was encouraged by the results, and have managed to improve upon them to the point where I'll use this technique for all my prototyping -- as long as I have access to a laser cutter... The secret ingredient? Adhesive mailing labels.</p>
<p>The full details are over at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sharebrained.com/2011/01/11/pcb-stencils-on-the-cheap-kinda/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to show people some of my results at the next meeting.</p>
