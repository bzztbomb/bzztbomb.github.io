<p>There's an <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/780943604/primer-a-kinetic-sculpture-that-generates-prime-nu">artsy dude </a>who got his Kickstarter mentioned on boingboing.&nbsp; The project is a little mechanical counter with some smarts built in: every time you press a button, it computes and displays the next prime number.&nbsp; It's $120.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HYW1u6epmDM" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"></iframe></p><p><!--break-->I had a couple of 6-digit counters that I got from Surplus Gizmos, so I thought this would be a fun afternoon project.&nbsp; It's almost like <em>getting</em> $120, except you can't spend it.</p><p>The video is an iPhone movie of my version computing primes from 137 to 167.&nbsp; During the development (ha!&nbsp; "Development!") I counted the number of primes between 2 and 1000000.&nbsp; There are 78,498 of them (first is 2, last is 999,983) and the largest gap between primes is 114, between 492,113 and 492,227.&nbsp; Just in case you're wondering.</p><p>The Teensy2 is overkill for this: the code is only 334 words (I think), and I have some ATtiny13s with 1K of Flash that would be perfect for this project.&nbsp; I just have to ressurect my Teensy-based ATtiny programmer...</p>
