    In order to encourage us to play with electronics more, <a href="http://jammed.com/~jwa/">JWA</a> and I have begun doing monthly challenges.  For our inaugural challenge, we decided upon an LED Birthday Candle.  This is my entry to that challenge.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/2350053369/" title="LED Birthday Candle by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2107/2350053369_3803998efb_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="LED Birthday Candle" /></a>You blow the center pole towards one side, and the LED shuts off.  To turn it back on again, blow it the other direction.  It's a circuit known as<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Bill_Bowden/page9.htm">a bistable multivibrator,</a> or "flip-flop".  I do like that it's so simple and cheap, though.My parts list is simply:2 - 10k ohm resistors1 - 1k ohm resistor1 - 220 ohm resistor2 - 2n3904 NPN Transistors1 - LED3 - AAA batteries (this thing'll last forever!)Not including the batteries, this thing costs less than 15 cents in parts.  If I could work out the "blow" mechanism a little better, I think this would be a marketable product.Okay, now for some photos:On the breadboard:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/2350875702/" title="LED Birthday Candle by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3181/2350875702_bb62452402_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="LED Birthday Candle" /></a>Before being shoved in the pill bottle:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/2350884870/" title="LED Birthday Candle by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2324/2350884870_d67cf9562d_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="LED Birthday Candle" /></a>I had originally wanted to be able to shove this thing into a fat straw, like you get with a bubble tea, so I made it as small as possible, and soldered the pieces together straight rather than using protoboard:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/2350882084/" title="LED Birthday Candle by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2036/2350882084_db84a59f08_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="LED Birthday Candle" /></a>Next: Brighter LEDs!<b>As Seen On:</b><a href="http://www.laen.org/2008/03/21/electronic-birthday-candle/">My Blog</a><a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/03/led_birthday_candle.html">MAKE Blog</a>
