The greater number we have, the better the component prices (in many cases) will be.</p><p><b>Why are you doing a group order instead of just buying them?</b> The easy answer is of course price. However, price isn't really what's driven us to make this order. We're putting our board order through [<a class="external text" href="http://pcb.laen.org/%7CLaen's" rel="nofollow">PCB Order</a>], which means the boards will be manufactured in the US. Secondly, we like to build stuff, and teach people how to build stuff. Purchasing our own components and our own boards gives us the opportunity to hold a hotplate reflow party, and make our own devices.</p><p><b>But shouldn't Dangerous Prototypes be compensated for their work?</b> Absolutely. That's why we've chosen to each chip in a bit extra and send Ian Lesnet something for his hard work.</p><p><b>How much?</b> It'll be somewhere around $15 + shipping (if you need it shipped). We won't have an exact price until we know how many people want to get a board (or a couple of boards). Once we have a count, we can determine quantity prices.</p><p><b>Okay, I want to get one too. What do I do?</b> Shoot an email to [<a class="external text" href="mailto:gpeekx@gmail.com%7CGreg" rel="nofollow">Peek</a>], he's handling the organization of who wants how many. The cutoff for requesting one is <b>February 10</b> (2012, if it's not obvious). After that we'll organize how to get your portion of the cost into the group purchase.</p><p>If you're outside the PDX area you're welcome to join us, but you may have a slightly higher price for shipping, and you'll miss out on the reflow party.</p><hr><p><strong>June 19, 2014</strong></p><p>I recently wanted to assemble one of the Dorkbot Bus Pirates but didn't have the .brd file to cut into a stencil. Those files (as well as the original Gerber files zipped up) are now attached to this post so they're available to anyone who wants one.</p>
