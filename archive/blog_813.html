<p>I just got back from the Occupation area in the park on the river-side of the court house. There are 200 to 300 people there, spirits are good.</p>
<p>I asked what were the most immediate needs of O.P.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FRS hand-held two-way radios for communication</li>
<li>"AAA" alkaline batteries (many), for the above radios</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also trying to make (or get) a human-powered bicycle-generator to re-charge batteries of cell phones, etc. If anyone happens to have such a thing, they could really use it!</p>
<p>Doing revolutionary things with electricity...</p>
