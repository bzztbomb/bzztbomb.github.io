<p><a href='http://processing.org'>Processing</a> is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions. During this workshop we will explore this environment and make some fun graphics! This workshop is aimed at people with little to no programming experience who want a playground to explore programming and graphics and for experienced programmers that just want an overview of what processing offers.</p>
