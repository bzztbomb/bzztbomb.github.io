<p>Hello all!</p><p>I just wanted to send out a quick introduction, I just joined about a week ago. I haven;t made it to a meeting yet, but hope to change that Monday.</p><p>I've been in the industry for ~17 years doing mostly HW design, with a good dose of SW mixed in. I've been stuck on arduino since a friend of mine told me about it a year or two ago. I've done many projects now from a talking clock to what I'm most proud of, Orbduino: <a class="external free" href="http://www.tnhsmith.net/Other/Orbduino" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnhsmith.net/Other/Orbduino</a></p><p>Currently I'm working on a data logger PCB, hoping to get it in for the next group order.</p><p>Looking forward to meeting you all,</p><p>Travis Smith</p>
