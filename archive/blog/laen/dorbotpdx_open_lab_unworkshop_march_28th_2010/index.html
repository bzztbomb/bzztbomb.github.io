    <p><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/3146429660_6a27029e0c.jpg'/></p><p>Where: PNCA, NW 12th and Johnson<br />When: March 28th, 2010 1pm-5pm<br />What: <b>OPEN LAB!</b></p><p>Bring your projects and work on them in a group setting. Bounce your ideas off other dorks. Void warranties.</p><p>We're treating this as kind of an un-workshop, which means its up to you to set the agenda. Reply to this post with your interests and try to get a group together to hack on them.</p><p>Some ideas:</p><ul><li>Propeller hacking. I know from the PCB orders that we have a bunch of people geeking on the Propeller platform.</li><li>PureData play. We have tons of PureData folks in the group. This would be a good place to get together and work on patches.</li><li>Circuit board designing. The PCB order goes out the evening after this Lab, so if you want help with your design, this is a good place to get it.</li><li>Arduino/Dorkboard/Teensy hacking.</li><li>Soldering practice. I'll have a bunch of Drawdio kits available, if you want to practice your soldering skills. They have spots for both surface mount and through-hole components, so take your pick.</li><li>Making things move. Messing with motors, servos, soleniods, etc. BYOMSSE (Bring Your Own Motors, Servos, Solenoids, Etc)</li></ul>
