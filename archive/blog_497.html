<p>As part of my studies at the Wiki Creek field station, I've become interested in longitudinal photographic surveys. I've now created a device to facilitate consistent panoramic captures based on permanent mounting of a monopod base.</p><p><a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/IMG_2737.preview.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="WikiPod prototype I" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/IMG_2737.preview.jpeg"></a></p><p>I describe the work on the Wiki Creek site:</p><ul><li><a href="http://c2.com/wikicreek/wiki.cgi?FixpointPanorama">http://c2.com/wikicreek/wiki.cgi?FixpointPanorama</a></li></ul><p>I will bring the engineering prototype to the DorkBot meeting tonight. I'm calling it the "WikiPod". (The name has worked well for me before.)</p>
