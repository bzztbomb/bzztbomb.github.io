    <p>For those who are interested in the Robotics Environment you've seen at Dorkbot meetings and might want to build a robot (maybe not quite as elaborate as Ward's), I've posted two Instructables you might want to check out. One even has a little video with it! Here are the links:</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-Easy-Robotics-for-the-Non-Programmer/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-Easy-Robotics-for-the-Non-Programmer/</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Robotics-Breadboard/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Robotics-Breadboard/</a></p><p>The second prominently features the Teensy2 and has a cameo by Dorkboard.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><pre>                    -jim</pre>
