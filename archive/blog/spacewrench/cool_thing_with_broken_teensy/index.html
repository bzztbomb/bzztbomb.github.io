His evil bargain: you can have one for free, but you have to do something cool with it within a year, and then take a picture of it.  If you don't ...</p><!--break--><p><i>cue minor 9<super>th</super> music...</i></p><p>... you have to buy Paul ...</p><i>minor 13<super>th</super> hit x 3!</i><p><b><i>A Beer<blink>!</blink></i></b></p><p>Well, I got home, and the first thing I noticed was I had these little Avago LED displays sitting around, and they were kinda about the same size as the Teensy.  And, hey, the pins line up!  And hey, the power & ground are at the right end!  And hey, the pins are <i>just</i> long enough to reach the board if you put the module over the USB connector!  Plus, I'd been meaning to do something like this, except with a USB-B connector so it would stick out like a thumb drive.  But you can't get <u>that</u> close and not try it, right?</p><p>My eventual goal is to put a noise source on the board and deliver random bits to the USB host, plus scroll random letters across the display.  Good for ... I dunno ... randomness?  I bet this is one of those ideas that sounds better in the abstract than in the implementation.</p><p>Anyway, thanks, Paul!  I'll buy you a beer anyway.  And maybe contribute one of my two remaining Avago displays to the Free Parts Pool.  Anybody else got an idea for a tricked-out Teensy?</p><table border="0" width="60%"><tr><td><a href="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/node/531"><img src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/Yow-1.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="75" title="" alt="Yow!" /></a></td><td><a href="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/node/532"><img src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/Yow-2.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="75" title="" alt="Yow 2" /></a></td><td><a href="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/node/533"><img src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/Yow-3.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="75" title="" alt="Yow 3" /></td></tr></table><hr><small>(Man, I <i>so</i> do not understand this software.
