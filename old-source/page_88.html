The application of circuit bending techniques to children's toys and electronic musical instruments often yields unintentional and interesting results. As an art, circuit bending has a low bar of entry (little or zero electronics experience is required) and a low cost (most devices are inexpensive and readily available).</p><p>Workshop attendees will be given a brief background on the subject and will be shown common techniques and precautions. Attendees will be guided through the hands-on dismantling and circuit bending their own circuit bent instrument.</p><p>The event is hosted by <a href="/wiki/JasonPlumb">Jason Plumb</a> of <a href="http://noisybox.net">noisybox.net</a> and <a href="http://infiltrationlab.com">infiltration lab</a>.</p><p>Seating is limited to 30 people, so please <a class="external text" href="mailto:jason@noisybox.net&amp;cc=tlockney@gmail.com&amp;subject=HAYWIRE" rel="nofollow">RSVP</a> to guarantee a spot. Unreserved slots will be filled on a first-come first-serve basis on the day of the workshop.</p><p>For more information and details, please visit the <a href="/wiki/HaywireCircuitBendingWorkshop2008">Haywire Circuit Bending wiki page</a>.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Agenda:"><b>Agenda:</b></span></h4><ul><li><b>3:45 - 4:00pm</b>&nbsp;: Setup and registration</li><li><b>4:00 - 5:00pm</b>&nbsp;: The history and theory of circuit bending</li><li><b>5:00 - 5:30pm</b>&nbsp;: Hands-on demonstration of techniques</li><li><b>5:30 - 8:30pm</b>&nbsp;: Collaborative, assisted circuit hacking session</li><li><b>8:30 - 9:00pm</b>&nbsp;: Conclusions/cleanup</li><li><b>9:00 -&nbsp;?:??pm</b> &nbsp;: HAYWIRE Recital</li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="What_to_bring:"><b>What to bring:</b></span></h4><p>Attendees are not <i>required</i> to bring any tools and supplies, but it is strongly encouraged.
