    <p>Feeling in the "message in a bottle" spirit, but more like an 8-pin DIP in a locket sort of mood, I ordered EEPROM from Sparkfun. I'm sort of a noob and have only been to a few meetings so far. So it took me a couple hours today, but I uploaded a sketch I gathered from a YouTube video and wired it up like a picture on Fritzing's site and got it all running. I can lock away 256 characters for up to 200 years with no power attached on a tiny chip!</p><p>I just reposted the resources to a Tumblr I set up, which is propgating the webz for the next 72 hours as stiltzkin.com. I have a question regarding the sketch, which is how to address (I imagine 23 other spaces?) to read/write to. I just have 0x50 right now. Sorry if I made this post wrong, it's my first one and my first project with my Arduino.</p><p>ps: hello everyone.</p>
