    This is general wiki space for dorkbotpdx pure data information sharingFirst off - thanks to everyone who came out to our workshop last Sunday/workshop/pd/2-interfacing_with_the_world!<strong>***we will have an open lab at PNCA on Sunday March 28th. bring your project and questions!***</strong>Jason posted a blog entry with two of the patches from the workshop <a href= "/blog/breedx/pd_patches_from_the_workshop">here</a>We will update this page soon with new Midi Monster firmware, instructions for loading it onto your hardware - as well as information about wiring pots and more patches.Please feel free to add your own notes/thoughts/links to this page. If you've been physically interacting with PD since the workshop - please share!Here's an interesting link I found - it builds a little bit on the simple sampler patch Alex demonstrated. A grid of buttons hooked into the midi monster would make a nice interface for something like this:http://docs.monome.org/doku.php?id=dev:pd:simple_mlr
