    <p>The <a href="http://churchofrobotron.com/">Church of Robotron</a> is coming to Portland, OR. We will be open the Last Wednesday of September (the 24th) and the First Thursday of October (the 2nd)&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">starting at 7pm both nights&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">at the </span><a href="http://diodegallery.com" style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">Diode Gallery</a><span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;"> (514 NW Couch St) which is across the street from </span><a href="http://groundkontrol.com/" style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">Ground Kontrol</a><span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">. We'll have multiple versions of Robotron 2084 available to train with and we will be triggering physical events in response to game events. One example: lasers when lasers are shot in game. For info about how this is accomplished, check out this </span><a href="/blog/skinny/use_mames_debugger_to_reverse_engineer_and_extend_old_games" style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">older post</a><span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">.</span></p><p>Right now, we have an installation in the window at the gallery which is running 24/7 until October 3rd. It features a fully playable version of Robtron 2084, sermons, and a leaderboard that has pictures of all who attempt to become the mutant savior. Here's a video of it:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="367" mozallowfullscreen="" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/105526621" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V77s2fru-lk" width="640"></iframe></p><p>The window sensor is a capacitive sensor that was made by Philip Odom. He used the same techniques he taught during the <a href="/capacitive_sensing_workshop_2014">Capacitive Sensing Workshop</a>. Jason Plumb got audio working by using a transducer that turns the window into a speaker. The sign was built by Debbie Wager. Finally, this was all integrated together by the rest of the church.</p><p>Come check out the window anytime! Come to our open nights (9/24 &amp; 10/2), check out this <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/08/20/toorcamp-the-church-of-robotron/">post</a> for an idea of what to expect!</p><p><!--break--></p>
