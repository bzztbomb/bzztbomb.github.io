<p>The nice thing about blogging is that you can remember what you've done. I'm doing exactly that for my other friends at Portland's own open-source conference. Here's how I describe my talk:</p>
<p><img alt='img' src='/files/images/Screen%20shot%202011-04-23%20at%208.33.56%20PM.preview.png'/></p>
<p>I'll be dragging some hardware to the conference for live demos. That got me thinking, what else could I throw together? So ...</p>
<p>I hooking together some Txtzyme controlled gizmos on my long-ignored <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="/blog/wardcunningham/old_robot_learns_to_dance">robot platform</a>. (Thanks go to Jim Larson for putting together an H-Bridge motor controller for it and reviving my old laptop to run it.)</p>
<p><img alt='img' src='/files/images/IMG_0020.JPG'/></p>
<p>For interface I browse a bunch of cgi scripts hosted by the robot's webserver and run them from my phone.</p>

<p>A list of CGI scripts doesn't sound like a particularly sophisticated interface, does it? I'm pleased to report that it works pretty well. For thirty five years I been thinking about what I'd do with my robot when I finally finish it. In none of those years could I think up things as fast as when I'm actually programming it.</p>
<p>This is why I keep going on about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="/blog/wardcunningham/shell_programming_with_txtzyme">Txtzyme</a>. Its fast and friendly, just like the shell. CGI scripts, you must realize, are only one stepped remove from shell commands, an important point in my open-source talk.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more. The source.cgi script shows you the source for each script you are about to execute. The blink.cgi script is instructive. It blinks the awesome semi-tractor-trailer amber running light I just installed on my bot to attract attention at tomorrow's Dorkbot meeting.</p>

<p>Bring your smart phone. You're welcome to blink my lights yourself from the safety of your own cell-phone browser. (My robot's zeroconf url is <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://vn.local/~ward/robot">[1]</a>)</p>
<p>I've still got Sunday to cook up some more fun things to do so expect some surprises. Watch for 'em.</p>
