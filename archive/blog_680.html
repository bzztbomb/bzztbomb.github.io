Tonight I...

<ul>
  <li>...rode a bicycle across two bridges.</li>
  <li>...was approached by a man and a woman (both strangers) and was told "we wish to join the cult".</li>
  <li>...witnessed a man tapping a plastic pad connected to a tangle of circuits and wires and causing a drum sound to be played.</li>
  <li>...saw a pair of multicolor robot eyeballs glowing on a tabletop</li>
  <li>...witnessed a middle-aged man <em>covered</em> in a mass of glowing LEDs and EL wire.</li>
  <li>...listened to the sound of a cello convolved with the impulse response from a wooden door.</li>
  <li>...helped a woman field test a subversive, covert anti-television teddy bear implant prototype.</li>
  <li>...watched a slot car adjust its speed in response to a computer's system load average.</li>
  <li>...was in good company.</li>
</ul>
