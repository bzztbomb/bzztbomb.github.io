    <p>Following <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://hackaday.com/2010/09/30/launchpad-takes-ultra-low-power-to-the-extreme/">a post on Hackaday</a>, I dug out an old LCD display and wrote a little program to run it. In normal/active mode, according to my mediocre meter, the whole thing draws 90-100uA. When you put it in sleep mode, it draws nothing. (Edit: I measured with a 5K sense resistor...at 3V, it appears to draw about 3.25uA. Not very much at all!) I hope I can find one of those little SO-8 solar cells to try with this!</p>
