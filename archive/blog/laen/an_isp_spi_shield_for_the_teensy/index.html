With the inclusion of a functional AVRISP MKII (and PDI!) programmer in <a href="http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php">LUFA</a>, I thought it would be fun to make a programmer board to take advantage of it.This is an programmer "shield" for the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy2</a>.  Solder on some headers, plug in your Teensy, flash it with the LUFA AVRISPMKII code, and you have a functional ISP programmer.<!--break-->This also works as a Serial, SPI, and i2c breakout board, since those pins are brought out into convenient headers.Put a jumper on the "PGM" pins, and you can use the ISP pins to flash program the teensy itself. Useful if you've lost your bootloader somehow.The EAGLE board files are released under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License</a>.
