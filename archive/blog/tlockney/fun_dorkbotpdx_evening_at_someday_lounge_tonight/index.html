    <p>Come join us this evening at <a href='http://www.somedaylounge.com'>Someday Lounge</a>. We've been invited to bring our particular brand of dorkiness and geekdom and show it off. This will be much like our usual meetings (so bring your toys!) but we'll also be giving folks the opportunity to make a lot of noise and get up on the stage.</p><p>The fun begins at 9PM and among the activities will be:</p><ul><li>Don, performing on the computer-enhanced bass guitar</li><li>Jason and Jared, aka CRM114 Discriminator, performing an avant/noise piece originally premiered at ToorCamp</li><li>Simran, with the feedback organ</li><li>Peter, with his suitcase of mystery</li><li>You!</li></ul><p>Seriously, if you have something you'd like to show off, let us know and we'll get you some time on the mic. Preferrably, ping Jason, Don or me beforehand so we have some idea of what to expect, but don't worry if it's all last minute. We'll be setting up at 8, so feel free to come down early and to help out or just hang out and keep us company.</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=125+NW+5th+Avenue,+Portland,+OR+97209&amp;sll=45.429522,-122.705794&amp;sspn=0.00771,0.01929&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.524901,-122.675765&amp;spn=0.007697,0.01929&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Here's a map</a> if you don't know where it is -- but if you've been to one of the Monday night meetups, it's just around the corner.</p><p><br /></p>
