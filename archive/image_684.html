<p>I've been meaning to do this for a couple of years now, and here it is. The beginnings of it, anyway. I wanted nixie-tube house numbers, but my house doesn't move, so I only need one digit per tube. And BIG. I need BIG. So I built some microcontrollers for a glass-artist friend's installation, and in return, he made me some glass tubes. I got some EL wire in the mail today, and this is what I made.</p>

<p>The EL wire isn't very bright, because I'm only driving it with ~84VAC. When I boot it up to 200VAC, I'm hoping it'll look better.</p>
