<p>I thought I found a bug testing blinking <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/blog/wardcunningham/shell_programming_with_txtzyme">Txtzyme</a> examples. Although I could see the Teensy LED blinks uniformly and distinctly, I saw the wrong number of blinks. It turns out the bug is in my brain, not my program, as this data shows:</p><p><img alt='img' src='http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/Screen%20shot%202010-06-15%20at%2011.29.22%20AM.png'/></p><p>The data shows how many times I saw a particular number of blinks (the columns) when the blinks had a half-cycle period of a particular millisecond duration (the rows).</p><p>Here is the loop I used to acquire this data:</p><dl><dd>`say ready`;</dd><dd>while() {<dl><dd>`echo 300m5{1o${period}m0o${period}m} &gt;$teensy`;</dd><dd>$result = getc;</dd><dd>last if $result =~ /[1-9]/;</dd><dd>`say again`;</dd></dl></dd><dd>}</dd><dd>`say good`;</dd></dl><p>I'm using the mac's voice synthesis so that I can focus on the blinking. Any invalid response repeats the stimulus. This way I could watch the blink over and over until I was sure.</p><p>My <i>brain bug</i> is that although I perceive each light pulse clearly, distinctly and uniformly, my number perception <i>drops pulses</i> when they come too fast. I've measured my speed threshold to be around 200ms. I've tested others and found that this number varies.</p><p>I'll expect Dorkbot regulars to give this test a try at next Monday's meeting. I've also posted code and more results as another <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://github.com/WardCunningham/Txtzyme/tree/master/projects/blink/">Txtzyme project</a> on GitHub.</p>
