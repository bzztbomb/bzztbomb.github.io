I needed to use one of the <a href="http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-wired-embedded-solutions/zigbee-rf-modules/point-multipoint-rfmodules/xstream-module.jsp?tab=productdocs&pid=3315#docs">Digi/Maxtream OEM RF modules</a> in a project. There's no Eagle library I could find for them (the maxstream library only has the Xbee). So I drew one up. it can be downloaded <a href="http://www.aracnet.com/~drtwist/xstream.lbr">here</a> if you have comments, please drop me a note in the comments section.
