    I spent some time over the weekend trying to see what my board etching capabilities actually are.  I use toner transfer, and I thought that kind of limited my options, as far as how fine of detail I could get.   I made <a href="http://content.laen.org/electronics/toner-test.pdf">this test pattern</a> with a variety of surface mount components and line sizes, then tried to transfer them to copper with a couple of different methods.First, I used a clothes iron, several different temperature settings and applying differing amounts of pressure.  This is the one that turned out the best:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/3473542445/" title="Experimenting with Toner Transfer by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3307/3473542445_a55c082b23.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Experimenting with Toner Transfer" /></a>(<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3307/3473542445_586977f059_o.jpg">Full resolution</a>)<!--break-->Then, I switched to a laminator.  After sending it through a dozen times (top and bottom), I got this:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/3474351184/" title="Experimenting with Toner Transfer by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3331/3474351184_bc82c0f643.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Experimenting with Toner Transfer" /></a>(<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3331/3474351184_a2825ebdc2_o.jpg">Full Resolution</a>)MUCH better.  I can do .001" lines sometimes, and .005" lines consistently.   I can _almost_ do TFQP-100, and I can certainly do any of the other TQFPs.
