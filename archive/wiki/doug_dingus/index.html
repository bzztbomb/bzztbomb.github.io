    <p>My computer related hobby interests are:</p><p>Parallax Propeller micro controllers. Video, sound, game, SD card, driver type projects. Assembly language.</p><p>Atari 8 bit computers and game consoles. I've written code for both, and enjoy doing that, from time to time.</p><p>Tandy Color Computer 3. (Come on, it's got a 6809, what's not to like?) Most recent work there was getting NTSC artifacting technology out to the current user base. I'll upload a few screenies later on. It has to be seen to be believed. Who knew that machine had the capability it does?</p><p>I also enjoy writing on a variety of subjects.</p><p>Contact! dorkbot at opengeek.org (don't look to close at that blog --I've not updated it in a while)</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
