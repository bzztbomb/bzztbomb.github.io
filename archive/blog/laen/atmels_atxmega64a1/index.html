I just got these beauties from Mouser today:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/3451636198/" title="Atxmega64A1 by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3590/3451636198_1af17fd1db.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Atxmega64A1" /></a>This is one of the first of the ATXMega line of chips, and _boy_ what a beautiful chip:* 8 USARTS.* 4 i2c busses* 4 SPI busses* AES and DES Cryptoengines* 2 eight-channel, 12-bit ADCs* 2 two-channel, 12-bit DACs,* a built in 32kHz factory calibrated oscillator for the Real-time Clock* built in 2MHz and 32MHz factory calibrated oscillators* A 31x PLL which can be used as the system clock (for a top chip speed of 200MHz).All for $6.40 a chip, quantity 10.Now I need to make a board for it. <img width=529 height=471 src="http://content.laen.org/electronics/xmegaboard.png">I might try doing a seeedstudio run.
