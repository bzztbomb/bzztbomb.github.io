Breadboard DC/DC Converter

Here's my latest PCB design.  It's a breadboard-mount DC/DC converter.  I run many of my projects off a big 12V battery because 1) I have one; 2) it holds a lot of energy; 3) it can put out a huge amount of current if I ask it to (this can also be bad -- I've smoked several devices when they weren't hooked up quite right and the battery did its thing.)

Anyway, I had dedicated a section of my 3-strip breadboard to power supply generation: 12V -> 5V and then 5V to 3V3.  But I saw an interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smps">SMPS</a> chip, the <a href="http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/13844/st1s10.pdf">ST1S10</a> (pdf), that uses a tiny 3.3uH and very little else to produce up to 2.5A of output.  So this is what I built.

The right-hand vertical rail is where 12V comes in, and the left-hand rail is wired around other parts of the breadboard as 5V and GND.

The chip fired up and worked immediately, no questions asked.  It's a little expensive, and overspec'd for most low-power microcontroller applications, but if you're doing a bigger project that might need a beefy power supply, this looks like an easy way to get it.
