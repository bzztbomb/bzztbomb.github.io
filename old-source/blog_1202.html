<p>Often I've been asked how to get synth control voltage (CV) into an analog input pin.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html">Teensy 3.1</a> has 13 bits effective analog resolution, good enough for many CV applications, but the stable internal reference is only 1.2V with analogReference(INTERNAL).</p><p>This simple circuit converts the -5V to +5V CV signal range to the 0 to 1.2V ADC input range.</p><p><img alt="" src="/files/images/schematic_cv.png"></p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: here's <a href="https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/28423-Audio-Adaptor-Board-to-manipulate-cv-signal?p=71257&amp;viewfull=1#post71257">a discussion about this circuit's details and limitations</a> (fancy opamp-based circuits can be better).<!--break--></p>
