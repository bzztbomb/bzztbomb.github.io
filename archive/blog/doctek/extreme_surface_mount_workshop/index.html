<p>Thanks to all who attend the Workshop! Watching the group go from shocked amazement at seeing the tiny parts placed with tweezers to the point where everyone built a board themselves in just a few hours was both fun and exciting for me. Hopefully, those experiencing the process had as much fun. The hot plate process worked great and the solder paste silkscreens Scott made on the Tech Shop laser were outstanding.</p><p>Ten more Dorkbots are off and running with Surface Mount Technology!</p>
