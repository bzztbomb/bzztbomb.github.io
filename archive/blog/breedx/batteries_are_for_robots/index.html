    <img src="/files/images/batteries_for_robots.png"/>As it turns out, I actually <em>was</em> planning on using these 9V batteries for one of their 3 apparent usages:  elevator switches (??), robots, and smoke detectors.  Apparently the smoke detector diagram was so vague that it warranted labeling, but the elevator indicator did not.  I think it looks like a smokeless ashtray maybe.Anyway, I was impressed to learn that these batteries are great for use in robots!
