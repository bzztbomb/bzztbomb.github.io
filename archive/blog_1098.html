<p>Hey everyone! I'm the lead organizer for the <a href="http://pigsquad.com">Portland Indie Game Squad</a>. Our <a href="http://patreon.com/PIGSquad">funding project</a> recently surpassed most of its goals – which are all resources being made available to the community – and I'm coming up with some higher-tier options. A 3d printer is definitely on my list for the board game/miniature game developers in the group, and I've been asking around for what people might recommend as a "beginner" setup, somewhere between $400 and $600.<br><br>Multiple people have been saying the $500 Solidoodle is the way to go, but any other opinions are appreciated.<br><br>Thanks!</p>
