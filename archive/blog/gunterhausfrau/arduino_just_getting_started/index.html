    <p>Background: Played with basic stamp in the past. Let the magic smoke out of alot of electronic widgets (including a 3 million dollar electron microscope... but that was my job sorta) Went to the indoctrination, parts 1 and 2. I now have a nice arduino (bare bones) that I've been fiddling with, thinking about....</p><pre>    temp control in the greenhouse I built last year    replacing the cheezy IR remote control on a centipede "robot" that I ordered from Japan last year, to make it a real live robot    today's shiny object is video out, seems like the analog tv cost should be going way down soon (I pick up B&amp;W tv's at thrift stores for a a couple of $ and make them more interesting... (sometimes by only turning them off)    ??</pre><p>now all I need to do if figure out how to get the time to do all of this...</p>
