<p>Six years ago, in early Deceber 2008, I left the simple world of serial-based development behind and went native USB, releasing Teensy 1.0.&nbsp; So much has happened and I've learned a lot in just 6 years.&nbsp; I used to do everything by 9 pin RS-232 serial ports.&nbsp; Those days seem so distant.</p><p>I'm now working on new and really awesome USB features for 2015...</p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/usbproject.jpg" style="width: 720px; height: 552px;"></p>
