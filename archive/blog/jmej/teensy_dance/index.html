(Video above)My part of the collaboration was to generate audio/music for the dancer (Suniti Dernovsek), and to create a physical object facilitating audience interaction with the sound/music for the dancer.<a title="IMAG0398 by jesse.mejia, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56322419@N04/5906218383/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6050/5906218383_53fa925e74.jpg" alt="IMAG0398" width="500" height="299" /></a><a title="IMAG0393 by jesse.mejia, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56322419@N04/5906234205/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6054/5906234205_f0f453f973.jpg" alt="IMAG0393" width="500" height="299" /></a>I used a <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html">Teensy++</a> , an excellent microcontroller development system created here in Portland by a friend of mine - <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/">Paul Stoffregen</a>. It's an AVR based microcontroller - in some ways similar to the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, but utilizing a different chip with more i/o, and memory, a smaller footprint, and real USB onboard a single chip. Not really being a programmer, I used Paul's modified Arduino IDE (Teensyduino), which allowed me to play with plenty of existing Arduino examples floating around the net. It was simple enough to get my 3 buttons, 1 switch, and 1 potentiometer to send out Midi data using Paul's Teensyduino USBMidi library - and from there I could pipe audience interactions via those buttons, to a patch I made in <a href="http://puredata.info/">Pure Data</a> to generate the audio. I also added a couple LEDs to light when certain buttons were pressed, or the switch was on/off.Pure Data is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FLOSS</a> visual programming environment geared primarily towards multimedia artists. It's the free cousin of the commercial <a href="http://cycling74.com/">MaxMSP</a>. My patch for this piece was based around an example patch I made for a recent <a href="/wiki/synthesis_workshop_in_pd">Dorkbot workshop</a> to demonstrate classic 2-operator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis">Chowning FM Synthesis</a>. For this piece I used 3 similar 2 operator synthesizers, plus one subtractive synthesizer, playing back a few simple sequences that are manipulated by the buttons, switch, and pot on the box. Each switch sends a simple midi on/off, which I then use to turn running sequences on/off, or in some cases to step through sequences.The Dancer takes her queues from the 3 different elements introduced by pressing the buttons, or flipping the switch.I'll put the pd patch, and teensyduino sketch on my website soon.. http://www.anestheticaudio.com
