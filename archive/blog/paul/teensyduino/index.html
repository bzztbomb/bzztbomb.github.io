It turned out to be a lot more work than I expected, but finally I've released the first beta test of <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html">Teensyduino</a>, an add-on package for Arduino-0012 that adds support for the Teensy!  I even wrote a nice gui-based installer (works on Mac, Linux and Windows).<img src="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino_installer.png">
