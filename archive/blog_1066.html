Quality Audio on Teensy3 with Arduino

<p>Over the last couple weeks I've been working on supporting quality audio (44.1 kHz, 16 bit) on Teensy3 using very simple Arduino style programming.&nbsp; This weekend I added buttons and knobs to control parameters....</p><p><img alt="" src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/audio_proto.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"></p><p>This work is still at an early stage.&nbsp; I hope to publish a first alpha test version in about 1 month...</p><p>Edit: just a bit more info: The library manipulates audio with a collection of input, synthesis, processing and output objects that can be connected together in almost any way.&nbsp; Audio connection objects automatically move the 16 bit data and run the synthesis and processing algorithms in the background, so the user's sketch isn't burdened with high bandwidth, real-time data manipulation.&nbsp; The objects provide functions that can modify their behavior (volume, oscillator frequency, note on/off, modulation, etc) which can be used with extremely simple Arduino-style sketches, because the objects automatically handle all high speed data computation and movement in the background, triggered by interrupts and DMA transfers.</p><p>Designing a sytem to make excellent quality audio on Arduino with powerful features but also extremely easy has definitely turned out to be quite a challenge.&nbsp; I'm still redesning the connection object's base class.&nbsp; Much work remains, but now with I2S and PWM output working, .wav file playing and DDS sine wave generation all working, it really feels like it's starting to come together.&nbsp; I hope to have the API stable enough (stable = unlikely to incompatibly change) for a first releast by October.</p><p><!--break--></p>
