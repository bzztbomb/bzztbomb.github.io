<p>I've put photos of two pieces (I tried really hard to avoid the glare from the glass, please forgive) up in the dorkbotpdx flickr page. Your comments are welcome! They're not quite as sophisticated as some of the stuff I've seen from other dorkbot...er...ites, but, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship between electronics and myself.</p>
