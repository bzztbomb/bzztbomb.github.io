<p>I am looking for assistance (I will pay for your help) to design a Power distribution board for QuadCopters.&nbsp; This is a two sided board with heavy copper due to the large load of up to 6 motors.</p><p>The board should be about 30mm in circumference with positive leads on one side and Negative leads on the other.&nbsp; I am not sure if holes need to be drilled to aid in the soldering of 16ga wire.&nbsp; I have a cad drawing I can email if you are willing to help.&nbsp; I also would like the Power Distribution boards cut out of the sheet into 30mm disks.</p><p>If you can help please contact me, either here in the board or at dan@DiyQuadCopters.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
