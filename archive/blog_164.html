7:00pm at the Lucky Lab NW

Come get your dork on!  There will be a group of us meeting at the Lucky Lab NW tomorrow, May 26th at around 7pm to talk and show off our tech/art/mad endeavors.   Bring a project and a question and a concept and an inquisitive mind.  We're a very approachable and friendly group that readily welcomes newbies, seasoned hacks, and everyone in between...just look for an excess of laptops and electronic components and say "Hi.".

Sadly, it seems that Ethan, the spark shooting shockatronic dinotron won't be present.  He really made an impression last time (I think most victims have made it out of surgery).
