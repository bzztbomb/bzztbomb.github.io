<p>Instead of a weekly order, 2 layer circuit boards are now sent to the fab when the panel fills up. This means panels are going out 2 to 3 times a week instead of just once a week.</p><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">Contents</span></p><div class="toc" id="toc"><ol><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#New_ordering_website.21_&lt;a  data-cke-saved-href='http://oshpark.com' href='http://oshpark.com'&gt;OSH Park!&lt;/a&gt;"><span class="toctext">New ordering website! </span></a><a href="http://oshpark.com">OSH Park!</a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Order_Status"><span class="toctext">Order Status</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#What_is_this.3F"><span class="toctext">What is this?</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Who.27s_eligible"><span class="toctext">Who's eligible</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#What_you_get"><span class="toctext">What you get</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#The_Costs"><span class="toctext">The Costs</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#How_to_submit_your_order"><span class="toctext">How to submit your order</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Help.21"><span class="toctext">Help!</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#Design_Rules"><span class="toctext">Design Rules</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#File_Format"><span class="toctext">File Format</span></a></li></ol></div><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">New ordering website! </span><a href="http://oshpark.com" style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">OSH Park!</a></p><p>4 layer orders are now every two weeks.

Don't sweat it if you don't know what any of this means or you're not sure if your files match up. I'll figure it out.&nbsp;:)</p><ul><li>If you can just send an Eagle brd, and you're fine with the default of having just the Name, Place and _tsilk/_bsilk layers on the silkscreen, then do that.</li><li>If you're sending gerbers, make sure they're rs-274x (the default in any modern package), and are "positive layers" (also the default).</li><li>If you're using something other than Eagle: Set your drill file to 2:4 precision, no zero suppression, absolute positioning, and (if using kicad) "minimal header" and make sure "mirror y axis" is OFF.</li><li>If you're using DipTrace, it helps me if your filenames have a board name in them ("Board1-Top Layer.gbr" instead of just "Top Layer.gbr").</li></ul><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-Laen</p>
