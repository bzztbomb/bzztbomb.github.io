<p><a href="http://makerfaire.com/bay-area-2014/">Maker Faire</a> went really well.&nbsp; I had a booth about the new <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html">audio library</a>, and we also built a <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OctoWS2811.html">OctoWS2811</a> LED display for <a href="http://www.freescale.com/">Freescale's</a> booth.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/mf2014_1_0.preview.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 418px;"></p><p>Click "Read more" for more photos...</p><p><!--break--></p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/mf2014_2.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/mf2014_3.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 506px;"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a large 4320 LED display we made for Freescale.&nbsp; It plays 30 frames/sec video and 44100 sample/sec 16 bit audio from a SD card, using a single <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy31.html">Teensy 3.1</a>, <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/octo28_adaptor.html">OctoWS2811 adaptor</a>, and a <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/wiz820_sd_adaptor.html">WIZ820+SD adaptor</a>.</p><p>It's large and incredibly bright.&nbsp; Even these photos from quite a distance away, in a brightly lit room, look like nighttime due to the camera's exposure adjustment.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/mf2014_4.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 450px;"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/mf2014_5.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 450px;"></p><p>The Freescale folks were showing stuff people have made with their chips.&nbsp; The others I recall were the <a href="http://www.udoo.org/">UDoo</a> and a <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2686">iMX6 laptop</a>, which were also pretty awesome, but not nearly so bright.&nbsp; Freescale has been really great to work with (far, far better than Atmel ever was for Teensy 2.0), and they agreed to cover the material cost, so I was happy to help them with a LED demo.</p><p>The complete (but very early) source code for playing from SD card with audio is <a href="http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/25588-OctoWS2811-flicker?p=47485&amp;viewfull=1#post47485">available on this forum thread</a>.&nbsp; I'm planning to clean it up and roll it and other stuff into a new 1.2 release of OctoWS2811.</p><p>Here's a <a href="http://community.arm.com/groups/embedded/blog/2014/05/23/led-video-panel-at-maker-faire-2014">lengthy article I wrote about the LED video panel</a> on the ARM community website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
