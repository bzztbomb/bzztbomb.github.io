<p>Howdy y'all!</p>
<p>Terribly sorry to have missed the recent Cult Induction! Will be at the next one. And now it's time for something you'll really like: Portland area RadioShacks are discontinuing their stock of Parallax RFID Reader Modules (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bit.ly/apo2hl">http://bit.ly/apo2hl</a>) and are selling them off at $10 a pop (normally $50)!</p>
<p>I bought the only two available at the Woodstock store, but I know there are more out there. The clerk I spoke with said this is happening at all RadioShacks, but I don't know if that's nationally or just in Portland. If you go into a RS and the price is not marked down, ask the clerk to check the price on his computer.</p>
<p>This price is crazy. I hope it helps you make that wild RFID project you've been dreaming of!&#160;:) Cheers!</p>
<p>UPDATE: as of 10am 13-May, the Shack on 82nd has 3; Halsey has 3; Gresham has 3; and apparently Salem has some.</p>
