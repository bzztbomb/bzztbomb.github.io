<p>Finally got out of my box and attended a meeting, and wow. Neat stuff, the little breadboard hooked up to a TV showing all kinds of bars and squares was fascinating. Jason's Mylar speaker balloons were way cool, too, at least until smoking the little transformers he was using.</p>
<p>So supposedly there is a DorkBot event on March 30th, at PNCA, with presentations and such. Or maybe I heard Thomas wrong. Looking for more details, found none on web. Eyes open, mind alert. Will get Maxwell over there for robot representation.</p>
