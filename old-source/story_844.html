This workshop is suitable for newcomers to SMT as well as more experienced hobbyists who are looking for a reliable method for building projects using SMT. We will cover the basics of surface mount parts and the tools necessary to work efficiently with them, including a temperature controlled hot plate reflow system which you can build. And we will offer a hands on build session where you will go through all the steps in populating a PCB with parts and doing the reflow soldering process to end up with a working project.</p><p>No tools or prior experience is necessary although, if possible, you can bring a soldering iron, some type of magnifier (reading glasses, visor, etc) and a good pair of fine point tweezers. We will have some tools available to use during the workshop.</p><p>WHERE: ADX, 417 SE 11th Avenue, Portland, OR</p><p>WHEN: Sunday, January 29th, 2012, 1-5pm</p><p>Kits will be $8.00 each. Build a 2AA to 3.3V or 5V converter.</p><p>Jim Larson and Scott Dixon have a lot of experience teaching this course and are looking forward to doing so again.</p><p>Please RSVP by emailing Jim Larson: jlarson (at) pacifier.com</p><p>Class limit of 12.</p><p>(Picture by feurig)</p>
