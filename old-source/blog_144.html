<p>You know you've been sitting there thinking "why don't those two weeks go by faster? I *NEED* my DorkbotPDX fix, now!"</p>
<p>Well, I'm here to tell you that your wait is nearly over. In just 4 days time you can satisfy that need to hang out and socialize (a frightening concent, I know) with other freaks and geeks. Of course, I know there's a lot of newcomers out there, so don't be afraid -- we don't bite (well, Don might, but I'll leave that one for you to find out).</p>
<p>Bring your toys, your ideas and most of all your ability to have fun. We take all kinds and we don't turn anyone away.</p>
<ul>
<li>When: Monday, April 28th, 7pm</li>
<li>Where: Lucky Lab NW (not SE!)</li>
<li>Who: Dorkbot PDX and *you*</li>
</ul>
