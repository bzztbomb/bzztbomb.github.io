<p>Bytebeats radically reduce the already austere chiptune music to one-line formulas. When wrapped with a dozen more characters of C code these formulas will feed your sound card endlessly. Musicians speak of discovering bytebeats, not composing them. I've used a bytebeat dubbed Crowd as the background score for a one-day film shot yesterday. Note that I include the entire discovery in the film's credits (disrespectfully broken into two lines.)</p>

<p>Kragen has written a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/">good summary</a> of the short history of bytebeat with links to catalogs, videos, analysis and especially interactive tools for exploring them.</p>
