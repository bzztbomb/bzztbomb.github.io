He worked on it with his coworkers at OMSI. It uses a saber saw as the shaking mechanism. Pretty sweet. He's posted an&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/thunder-mansion/" style="line-height: 20.4px;">Instructable</a><span style="line-height: 20.4px;">&nbsp;about it if you're more interested.</span></p><p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/14196411@N07/22626409470/in/dateposted/" title="DorkbotPDX 11/2/2015"><img alt="DorkbotPDX 11/2/2015" height="225" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5742/22626409470_7169de61e7_c.jpg" width="400"></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/14196411@N07/22395991298/in/dateposted/" title="DorkbotPDX 11/2/2015"><img alt="DorkbotPDX 11/2/2015" height="300" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5806/22395991298_116e8f3ecd_c.jpg" width="400"></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p><span style="line-height: 20.4px;">Mykle Hansen brought his Teensy Synth project. It made some sweet, crunchy sounds. I think it is based off of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/brianmarkpeters/CHIP_BASED_SYNTHESIZERS/tree/master/TEENSY%20SYNTH" style="line-height: 20.4px;">this project</a><span style="line-height: 20.4px;">.</span></p><p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/14196411@N07/22395987257/in/photostream/" title="DorkbotPDX 11/2/2015"><img alt="DorkbotPDX 11/2/2015" height="240" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5823/22395987257_e9c28a285c_n.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p><span style="line-height: 20.4px;">Mathew Lippincott brought his Portal Gun from Rick and Morty.

It's not hooked up to his Bluetooth Barbie steering wheel yet, but maybe soon.
