    Save the date:  Sunday afternoon, 3/29/2009Where: <a href="http://pnca.edu">PNCA</a>, room 205, 1-5pm<a href='/files/images/mar09_openlab.png'><img src='/files/images/mar09_openlab.png' alt='open lab' width='500px'/></a>Come join Dorkbot Portland for a four-hour geek-a-thon in the heart of the Perl (yes, I went there) District.   Isotopes not required.What's all this then?  A bunch of us will gather in the drawing studio in room 205 on 3/29 at 1pm to partake in a free-form workshop.  Bring a pet project, tools, or simply your curiosity and desire to force technological constructs to meet your expressive inner nature.  We're nice, open-minded, artistic people with a bubbling technolust, a hot soldering iron, and stinky armpits.This is a place to brainstorm, but really to handstorm.  Bring your ideas, let's share and explore together.  Feel free to gloat, show-off, scorn, mimic, embrace, or destroy.  Hi.
