Three great and inspiring talks regarding art, electronics, computers, physics, and a hybridized mega monster of all things strangely technical. Did we mention 3D bluetooth kittens and RF aardvarks dancing to the synthesizer sounds of the microcontroller apocalypse? Ok, I made that up...or did I?<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Art_and_Electronics:_Arcing_the_Gap">Art and Electronics: Arcing the Gap</span></h2><p><b>Jesse Mejia</b></p><p>Jesse will present an overview of a few recently completed projects and a few works in progress. His talk emphasizes bridging the gap between artists and pseudo-engineers, and he challenges the community to come up with a proper term for this crossover behavior.</p><p>Jesse is an artist and AV nerd <a class="external text" href="http://www.anestheticaudio.com/" rel="nofollow">represented digitally at anestheticaudio.com</a>.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_Started_With_RF">Getting Started With RF</span></h2><p><b>Ward Ramsdell</b></p><p>Slides can be found here:<br><a class="external free" href="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/ward_ramsdell_0x07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/ward_ramsdell_0x07.pdf</a></p><p>Ward presents an overview of several affordable, contemporary wireless devices and demonstrates how they may be easily incorporated with today's microcontrollers.
