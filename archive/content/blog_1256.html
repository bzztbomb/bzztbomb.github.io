<p><em>You might have noticed some changes to the website.</em></p>

<p>We know that things are broken (like account creation and some past content). &nbsp;We are working hard to shore things up and make them functional again while also modernizing things. &nbsp;Please be patient, as progress is&nbsp;proceeding slowly...</p>

<p>If you notice something frustratingly broken or missing or out of place, or if you happen to be a Drupal ninja who wants to help out, please email <a href="mailto:jason@noisybox.net">jason@noisybox.net</a></p>

<p>Change is good, but comes with a cost. &nbsp;Nerd on!</p>
