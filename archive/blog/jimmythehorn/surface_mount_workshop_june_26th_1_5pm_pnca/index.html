<p>Learn how to work with surface mount technologies. This workshop is suitable for newcomers to SMT as well as more experienced hobbyists who are looking for a reliable method for building projects using SMT. We will cover the basics of surface mount parts and the tools necessary to work efficiently with them, including a temperature controlled hot plate reflow system which you can build. And we will offer a hands on build session where you will go through all the steps in populating a PCB with parts and doing the reflow soldering process to end up with a working project.</p><p>No tools or prior experience is required although, if possible, please bring a soldering iron, some type of magnifier (reading glasses, visor, etc), a desk or work lamp and a good pair of fine point tweezers. We will have some tools available to use during the workshop.</p><p>This workshop will take place at the Pacific Northwest College of Art (1241 NW Johnson St) in Room 207 from 1 - 5pm on Sunday, June 26th.</p><p>You will get a circuit board and parts kit for use during the class that is yours to keep.</p><p>Cost: $8</p><p>Please register by emailing jim at jimeastman dot com</p>
