<p>I did another run of the LCD enabled DorkBoard design that I posted earlier. In this run, I made a few small changes to add a standard 6 pin AVR ISP header and put in the reset capacitor (a 0603 part which can be solder bridged if you have a programmer like a Benito which does the reset in software). The Eagle files are attached.</p>
