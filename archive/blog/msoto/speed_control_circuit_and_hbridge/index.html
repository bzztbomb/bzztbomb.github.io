    <p>I am fairly new to robotics/autonomous vehicles. I have a quick question; maybe someone can answer for me. I have a little Hot Wheels RC car that I had gutted all the rc components off of; I am wanting to attach my dorkboard and control the speed and direction of the motors. I have a circuit design to produce a motor controller (H Bridge)( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/DCMotorControl">http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/DCMotorControl</a> ), but I would like to control the speed of the motors (14mph is too fast). How will I combine motor and speed control in one circuit and then use the dorkboard to control them? Here is a link to the car that I am using: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Wheels-R-Fury-FTX/dp/B000E6ELM8">http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Wheels-R-Fury-FTX/dp/B000E6ELM8</a></p><p>I guess I forgot to include the desire to control the servo as well.</p><p>Thank you Mike</p>
