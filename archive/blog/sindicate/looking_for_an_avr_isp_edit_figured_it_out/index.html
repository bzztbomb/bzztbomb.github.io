    <p>I've been using my arduino as an ISP for the Attiny 45's, but now i actually need to set some fuses. As far as I can tell, you must use a real ISP to do this. Anyone have an extra they want to part with?</p><p>Edit: Finally figured out i was just plain wrong. AVRISP does what i need it to. Nevermind!</p>
