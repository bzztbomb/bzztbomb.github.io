    <p>Ok - so I'm new to this - The Raspberry Pi got a lot more press than the Arduino and I jumped on board the Raspberyy Pi train without knowing the options.</p><p>My goal was to build a doorbell to solve the problem of not hearing it in all parts of the house (3 stories).</p><p>I followed this blog&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blog.solidstatediskshop.com/2012/raspberry-pi-doorbell-python/">http://www.blog.solidstatediskshop.com/2012/raspberry-pi-doorbell-python/</a></p><p>and it works - uses Python to detect a change of state when the button is pushed on one of the GPIOs - constant voltage state is 1 and when you press the doorbell it drops to zero - you have to hold the button in, for maybe a second, for it to reach zero. &nbsp;The script only detects a change so triggers the message/mp3 to tell us someone is at the door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The trouble is it goes off way too often (maybe 8 times a day) on it's own. &nbsp;Nobody has pressed it. &nbsp;Something is making the voltage drop slightly on the Raspberry PI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this because I need shiedling? &nbsp;Would an Arduino solve it for me? &nbsp;Which should I go for - something like:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fastestpc.co.uk/product/692153387/arduino-mega2560-a000067-board-r3.html">http://www.fastestpc.co.uk/product/692153387/arduino-mega2560-a000067-board-r3.html</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd welcome any feedback... &nbsp;Cheers James</p>
