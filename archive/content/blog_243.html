Making PCBs

I'm on a quest to make some PCBs.  I was going to wait for <strike>Portland</strike>Beaverton TechShop to open, but it's clear now that that's going to be a ways away.

I need boards to etch:
* Copper Clad Boards ("FR4", says drtwist) (1.6 mm thick (35um copper), says the riccibitti link below)
* Surplus Gizmos has tons of scrap copper clad.  It's also available very cheaply on ebay.

I ended up ordering 50 sheets of 1/2oz copper clad FR-4, 0.060 thick, 6"x11" from "abcfab" on eBay.

Special paper for transfering my design onto the boards (not strictly necessary, but may provide higher quality transfers)
* Toner Transfer Paper (Digikey 182-1003-ND)
* Green TRF (182-1021-ND) - improves quality of etching by binding to the toner.

I ended up using magazine paper.  It works really well, and is practically free, unlike toner transfer paper which is about $1 a sheet.  I haven't found the green TRF to be necessary.

Chemicals to etch with:
* Chemicals (Ferric Chloride or Ammonium Persulphate, says drtwist)

* I'll be getting some Sodium Persulfate from Travis.

I ended up using the muriatic acid + hydrogen peroxide version. (http://www.instructables.com/id/Stop-using-Ferric-Chloride-etchant!--A-better-etc/)

Chemical resistant gloves.  Latex?  Rubber dish gloves?
* Rubber dish gloves with the "water catcher" fold on the end.

I bought a box of Nitrile gloves.

Tinner? Flux?
* "liquid tin" from MG Chemicals is available from Norvac (from drtwist)
* Tinner probably isn't necessary with liquid flux.

Liquid tin makes the boards pretty and keeps the copper from oxidizing, which it _will_ do.

A drill press to drill holes (or I could just go 100% SMD)
* Dremel tool (already have it)
* Dremel Rotary Tool Work Station (order from Amazon) http://www.amazon.com/Dremel-220-01-Rotary-Tool-Station/dp/B00068P48O
* Drill bits.  Either micro-carbide (brittle, but works great with a dremel and FR-4 board), or steel (heats up and distorts.  Can rip up traces on the board.)  Harbor Freight in Portland seems to be a good place to get them. http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=34640

Snips to cut the board with.  FR4 dust is carcinogenic, so you want to make as little of it as possible.

An iron or laminator.  I bought and modified a GBC-H212 laminator.
