    <p>Howdy! I'm on a Robogames robotics team named Wonderblend. Basically, my friend and I are just two fairly ambitious, broke highschoolers. For fundraising we need to get as many people as possible interested in what we are doing, and that's what I'm doing right now. What better place for that than here, amongst the people doing strange things with electricity? Here's the Kickstarter link if you want to help us out: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderblend/wonderblend-a-combat-robot-made-by-highschoolers">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderblend/wonderblend-a-combat-robot-made-by-highschoolers</a></p><p>Thanks!</p>
