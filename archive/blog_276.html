The <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html">Teensy USB Development Board</a> is finally released!  I'm still writing more web pages and working on easier example code, but everything really necessary is available.

If you want to get it at the next meeting, just place an order with the website and in the comment box on step 3, just type something like "bring to dorkbot meeting", and of course you won't get charged any shipping.

Here are a couple pictures.
