<p>Updating my earlier Extreme Surface Mount Soldering Instructable, and based on some great work by Scott Dixon, I've posted a new Instructable. Check it out here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Closing-the-Loop-on-Surface-Mount-Soldering/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Closing-the-Loop-on-Surface-Mount-Soldering/</a></p><p>Included are complete instructions for modifying the sensor and all the software for control. This is a significant improvement to the old method. Enjoy!</p>
