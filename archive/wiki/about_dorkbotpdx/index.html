We meet on an regular, informal basis every other week, but you can find out more on our <a class="external text" href="/meetings" rel="nofollow">meetings page</a>. We occasionally hold larger events and workshops, so sign up for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mailing_lists" title="Mailing lists">mailing lists</a> to find out what's going on.</p><p>We welcome you to join us at our gatherings and to bring something interesting to view or ponder. Hands-on items (electrical, mechanical, digital, aural, visual, or other) are highly encouraged! Show and tell warrants mega ultra bonus points! If nothing else, just show up and tell us what you're interested in -- chances are good you'll find some creative feedback or meet someone with similar ideas.</p>
