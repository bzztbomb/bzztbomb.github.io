    Yesterday was the <a href='/workshop/pd/2-interfacing_with_the_world'>Pd interfacing with the world</a>workshop and we had a blast!  Thanks to everybody who came, and even bigger thanks to Alex, Jesse, and Don for pulling it together!For posterity, I am attaching two of the Pd patches here that I was temporarily hosting elsewhere.  If you didn't have a chance to attend, please feel free to check them out and play with them.<ul><li><a href='/files/fm_synth_patch.pd'>fm_synth_patch.pd</a> - The HID/joystick controlled FM synthesizer patch.</li><li><a href='/files/netsend_recv.pd'>netsend_recv.pd</a> - The netsend/netreceive demo patch.</li></ul>Hopefully soon we'll see some more technical info/specs on the <a href='/wiki/midimonster'>midi monster</a>, and then people can begin sharing info, ideas, and patches that they have created!<!--break-->
