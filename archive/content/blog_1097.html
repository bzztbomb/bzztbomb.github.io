<p>This weekend my friend Jacob S. and I built a Arduino based music box to play <a class="g-hovercard yt-uix-sessionlink yt-user-name " data-="" data-sessionlink="feature=watch&amp;ei=UsX3UvuTB-mSigKL44D4Aw" data-ytid="UCRRqeqAXdCC8GgatzHO3VWA" dir="ltr" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/viznut?feature=watch" name="watch">Ville-Matias Heikkil√§</a> wonderful one-line C code that makes surprisingly complex "Music From Very Short Programs."&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--break-->We used a Teensy 1.0 and the Arduino IDE for development.&nbsp; We used the Teensy to drive a Microchip MCP8422 SPI DAC and fuck-all for an amplifier.&nbsp; Much fantastic Portland beer was consumed, and here are the results.&nbsp; We think its awesome but we sure wish we understood why the hell it sounds so cool.&nbsp; Maybe Ville-Matias explains it somewhere.&nbsp; The DAC is 12 bits, and the programs are 8-bit so perhaps a talented composer could write even better music using those extra four bits.</p><p>See a video of our work at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgpUyEapCmM</p><p>See Ville-Matias' awesome original (complete with visualization) at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCRPUv8V22o</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
