Scott tested and programmed my hand-soldered Bus Pirate at the meetup last Monday.  Apparently it works.  Not sure when I'll actually use it, but nice to know it'll be ready to go....

Just wanted to post a high quality photo of the Bus Pirate board, Dorkbot PDX version.

Thanks Greg, Scott, Jim, Monty, Jared, and everyone else who had a hand in making this happen!  :-)
