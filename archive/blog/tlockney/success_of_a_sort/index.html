    <p>So, this last Sunday I finally had time to attend one of the open lab workshops <a href='/wiki/DonaldDelmarDavis'>Don</a> has been hosting for a while now. I went hoping to either finish putting together the <a href="/wiki/Benito" title="Benito">Benito</a> kit I had been sitting on for months now or to build a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lo_fi_Arduino_Guitar_Pedal/">Lo-fi Arduino guitar pedal</a>.</p><p>Sadly, I wasn't able to get very far on either of these. The capacitors I had for the Benito were mostly unlabeled and I soon found out that trying to test small value SMT caps with a meter was pretty much a losing battle without building some shorter custom leads. Eventually I just asked Don to supply me with a prebuilt Benito. Turns out he had one on him. So my plan of leaving with a working Benito actually did work out in a sense.</p><p>It turned out I also hadn't brought all the parts I needed for the Arduino pedal, so finally I just decided to spend my time looking around at what others were doing. Thankfully I had my camera and got a few pics. Here's what things looked like:</p><ul><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3117/3145596201_6d256d430f.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/3146429660_6a27029e0c.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3125/3146437338_17446ce9b6.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/3145597943_5347f1e50e.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/3145600009_5cd5e1b1c3.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/3146431488_b91f47b5ac.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/3145600775_9039ff3233.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3102/3146434300_0a2ed7bbc2.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/3146435050_b80de62664.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3139/3145604115_bb78d5c384.jpg'/></li><li><img alt='img' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3125/3146437338_17446ce9b6.jpg'/></li></ul>
