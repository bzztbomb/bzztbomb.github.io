<p>I went through the Arduino Cult Induction on Sunday and had a good time (once I got to the correct address). I was so happy, I went to Surplus Gizmos and bought another Dorkboard to play with. However, the microcontroller (Mega8) I bought didn't have the bootloader installed. So I tried to use my working Dorkboard to burn the bootloader onto the new Dorkboard. It didn't work. I got a verification error on the first byte.</p><p>I was adapting the instructions here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP">http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP</a></p><p>Anybody have some helpful tips or suggestions?</p><p><br /></p>
