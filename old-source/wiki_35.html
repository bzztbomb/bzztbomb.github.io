DorkbotPDX is currently building a car for entrance in the 2007 Portland Adult Soapbox Derby.  This page is a central area for collaboration.

So....first things first:

1) <b><a href="http://www.soapboxracer.com/rulz.php">RTFM</a></b>

All on the same page?  Excellent!  Now the fun part:

<h3><b>Ideas</b></h3>

Let's throw around a few ideas and see what sticks.  After a few weeks, we'll pick the best one(s).

<ul>
<li><b>Centipede</b><br /> ala <a href="http://www.hlj.com/product/GAK166448">Mechamo Centipede</a></li>
<li><b>Steampunk car</b><br />sketch below, but thinking of using an <a href="http://www.kentuckybarrels.com/">old whiskey barrel</a> for the body.  Bottom 3rd cut off to act as rear, top 2/3 as front, with spacer between for seat and post steering column, like in a  <a href="http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Design/Gartman/Car%20Parts/Model-T-Images-for-Tough-Gu.gif"> Model T</a>.  There should be a large (enclosed, sadly) Tesla coil mounted on the back, with <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/teaching/recruit/mad-scientist.jpg"> a base like this one</a>.  The front can hold ballast to make it heavier and faster.<br />
