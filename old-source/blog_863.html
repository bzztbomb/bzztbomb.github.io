<p>For the many of you who are wanting a BusPirate, here are the design files. The Schematic, the Board and the Gerbers as a zip. Please review and comment - we don't want any errors in this!</p>
<p>Special thanks to Monty for the DorkbotPDX logo. Who knew what artistic talent he has?&#160;;&gt;)}}</p>
<p>Also thanks to Monty, Scott D. and Greg P. for comments and suggestions while I was editing the board and Gerbering.</p>
<p>Most of all, thanks to Greg for organizing this whole adventure and to Jared for setting us off on it to begin with.</p>
