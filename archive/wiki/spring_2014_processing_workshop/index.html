    <p>Aiming for sometime in April (3rd Sunday?)</p><p>I missed Jeremy's workshop in 2012, if I had to guess, I bet it was a bit more well rounded than mine. ;)</p><p>Brian's notes/thoughts:</p><p>Previous workshop in 2010 had this sketch progression:&nbsp;Pixel manipulation, Mandelbrot Fractals, Shape/vector api, Text rendering, OSC library, Keyboard input, Video input, OpenCV integration (face detection)</p><p>Which I think worked well, but I'd avoid OpenCV this time around due to installation issues. &nbsp;But I wanted to have an "Advanced" topic for people that stuck around. &nbsp;This time around, it might be cool to do some sort of Information Visualization as a final project? Maybe grab some public data that's available about portland and visualize it in some cool way?</p>
