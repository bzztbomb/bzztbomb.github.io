<p><img alt='img' src='/files/images/21377_1.jpg'/> I'm a cellist with lots of experience in classical music. An interest in modern and avant garde music has gotten me into using electronic/computer technology to make music. I spent a year at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, where I began to learn about microcontrollers and design for human-computer interaction, among other things.</p>
