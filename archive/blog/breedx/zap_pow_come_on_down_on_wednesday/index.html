    Portland Dorkbot will be having an informal gathering on Wednesday, December 5th at 7:30pm at <a href="http://barvendetta.com/">Vendetta on N Williams</a>.  Come on down and bring your mom.We're generally pretty easy to spot.  Be on the lookout for out-of-place uncomfortable dorks with glowing laptop screens and piles of gadgetry on the tables.  Amen.Although this <em>is</em> an informal gathering, we always encourage people to bring their latest hacks to show off, work on, or just basically share with the group.  There have been some <em>very</em> thought provoking and creative discussions lately, and things are heating up for the beginning of 2008...so come on!
