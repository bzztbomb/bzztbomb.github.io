Come one! Come all!  To the first DorkbotPDX Open Lab, generously hosted by the Pacific Northwest College of Art.

As the name suggests, this is an open lab for working on whatever projects you want to work on.  It's a great place to show off works-in-progress, get help with a troublesome project, or to lend your expertise to someone doing something cool. It is also an opportunity for people who have paid for other workshops to follow up with anything that needs more work.

Bring your art projects, that could use the spark of electricity!
Bring your electronics projects, that could use a touch of art!

Bring your Arduinos!  Your Dorkboards!  Your PICs! Your ARMs!  Bring some extra exclamation points! Seriously.  I'm running out here.

Bring your soldering irons, your passives, your actives, and your power supplies and power strips.  Bring your imagination, and the stuff to make it happen.

<em>Time:</em> 1pm to 5pm, Sunday, September 28th
<em>Place:</em><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1241+NW+Johnson+St.,+Portland,+OR">PNCA</a>, Room 205
