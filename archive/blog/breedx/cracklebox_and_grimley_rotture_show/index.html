    <img src="http://noisybox.net/electronics/cracklebox/images/th/Cracklebox_009.jpg"/>I finally got around to putting up <a href="http://noisybox.net/electronics/cracklebox">a page for the cracklebox</a> project I completed a few weeks back.  Really a fun device...will be incorporating much more of it in near future recordings.The <a href="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a288/RayleneSteves/tg3.jpg">Grimley/Menche/SVS</a> show last weekend was so really totally fun and amazing and impressive on all kinds of levels.  Very inspiring.  Grimley is on the <a href="http://kboo.org">radio</a> right now...wish I would have had a chance to meet him and chat with him.
