<p>Since there's a lot of interest within DorkbotPDX in laser cutters, I wanted to pass this along. Although this is far from a cheap, easy project, you might find it inspiring. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/CO2-laser-that-cuts-sheet-metal/">http://www.instructables.com/id/CO2-laser-that-cuts-sheet-metal/</a></p>
<p>Who will be the first Dorkie to build an actual laser cutter??</p>
