<p>Does anyone have a CAD layout or part numbers for a diy servo controller with at least a 16 channel input(or potentially a site with cheaper but good components)? I have been looking for a little while and have found a few controllers with the necessary channels in but they are a little expensive. Thanks for any help you can give.</p><p>Clark</p>
