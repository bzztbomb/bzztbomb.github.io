<p>Hello Everybody! I'm a System Admin at a local ISP/Webhost/VOIP provider. Thats just my day job though. Most of the time I am downstairs in my little shop poking/breaking/fixing/making things. I'm somewhat new to the whole robotics arena. I am quite interested in the physical computing platform. Drop me a line.</p>
