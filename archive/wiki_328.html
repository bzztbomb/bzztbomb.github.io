<p>I'm a mechanical engineer. I tend to ask a lot of stupid questions to try to figure out what all these electronics and computer guys are talking about.</p>
<p>I used to be the senior engineer at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.music-man.com/">Ernie Ball/Music Man Guitars</a> in San Luis Obispo, CA, where I learned a lot about building electric guitars and basses, 3-D CAD (AutoCAD, Mechanical Desktop, Pro/E), CNC programming (Fadal, Thermwood, MasterCAM), and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTou5kOaOtY">building trucks that transform into concert stages</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I was a teacher. I taught woodshop, drafting, and computer animation. Sounds pretty cool, right? Wrong. I hated it.</p>
<p>Now I work for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.smithoptics.com/">Smith Sport Optics</a>. I do all of their 3-D CAD work, reverse engineering hand-made models for goggles, helmets, and sunglasses in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino</a> so that they can be produced by plastic injection molding.</p>
<p>I also make music, either in an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.myspace.com/armatronix">electronic format using old analog gear</a> or by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.myspace.com/wilddkingdommusic">playing bass in a band</a>. I like to collect and play vinyl records. I've done a lot of live sound engineering for bands, and some studio recording. I know a little bit about climbing big walls in Yosemite. And I have <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/armatronix/2573461059/sizes/l/">a cat</a>. I don't like dogs very much. Or children.</p>
<p>So far, I've made a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/armatronix/sets/72157614763946160/">MIDI-controlled, hi-intensity LED light set</a> for Portland band <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.myspace.com/fleshtonemusic">FLESHTONE</a>, and am working on a CAD controller to make my day job easier.</p>
