<h3>Open Dork</h3>

<b><i>Your project, your dime!</i></b>

OpenDork provides a flexible forum for people doing strange things with electricity to show off  their work in a quick, formal, but relaxed setting.  It's up to YOU!  Do a quick demo, brag, ask for help, show off your stuff.

OpenDork talks/demos are short (generally 5-10 minutes) and may have slides, or hardware, or both, or neither.  Get interactive!

<h3><a href="http://www.marisaolson.com/">Marisa Olson</a></h3>

<b><i>"Performed Listening"</i></b>

Marisa Olson's work combines performance, video, net art, sound, drawing, and installation to address the cultural history of technology, the politics of participation within pop culture, and the aesthetics of failure. Her work has recently been presented by the Whitney Museum of American Art, Centre Pompidou-Paris, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 52nd International Biennale di Venezia, the British
Film Institute, the Sundance Film Festival, and elsewhere. She's a Contributing Editor at Rhizome and Assistant Professor of New Media at SUNY-Purchase.
