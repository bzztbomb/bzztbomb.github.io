<p>Most of you folks know that I created a ZigBee radio design using the Atmel AT86RF230B a few months back and that I keep saying that I'll make it work "real soon now". Well, after a concentrated effort over the last two weeks, I have two of the radios talking! (I'm excited anyway.) One is hooked to a Teensy2++ as the Coordinator (a ZigBee term) and sends received data out the USB/serial link to display in a terminal window. The other uses a Teensy2, configured as a ZigBee Device, which sends a reading every ten seconds to the Coordinator for display.</p><p>They just started talking properly yesterday at 11:00pm, so I haven't had a lot of time to test them. What limited testing I've done shows a range around 100 feet. That's with the Coordinator inside and the Device outside wandering around with me. That means I can monitor stuff outside on my 50x100 estate and send the results inside without wires!</p><p>The picture shows one of the radios attached to the Teensy2 and floating above it. The BOM with the PCB is well under $10.</p><p>I'll have the units to demonstrate tomorrow night. See you then.</p>
