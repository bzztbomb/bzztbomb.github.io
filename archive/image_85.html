This is a work in progress -- originally intended to be used as an announcement flyer for the first November casual meeting, I later decided that although the idea is solid, the casuals just don't warrant it and I should be focusing my limited efforts elsewhere.  :)

Of course, if you feel motivated, you can download <a href="http://noisybox.net/dorkbot/images/announce_20071107.xcf">the original Gimp file</a> and tweak it and customize it to your liking!  Reuse and recycle!
