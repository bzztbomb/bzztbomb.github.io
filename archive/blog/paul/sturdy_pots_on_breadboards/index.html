<p>Often I throw together a quick demo for the bi-weekly DorkbotPDX meetup, usually involving one or more pots to adjust parameters.&nbsp; Finally, I've come up with a pretty good way to put pots on solderless breadboards.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/pot2.jpg"></p><p>Click "Read more" for details and the shared PCB....</p><p><!--break--></p><p>Here's the way I had been doing it.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/led5.jpg" style="width: 720px; height: 444px;"></p><p>These little thumbwheel pots work, but they're not easy to turn, and trying to turn them puts quite a bit of stress on the loose breadboard connections.&nbsp; They're also too low to the surface, so people's fingers get close to the wires and risk disconnecting them.</p><p>Socially, I've observed people tend to feel awkward touching these... maybe they don't want to break my project?&nbsp; Or maybe it's just not clear if they're supposed to be touched and adjusted?</p><p>With knobs on top of the pots, a last-minute project really looks like something you're supposed to touch!</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d80d1HWy5_s?rel=0" frameborder="0" height="480" width="853"></iframe></p><p>The ones in this video are actually the first version I made, with only 6 header pins.&nbsp; Those worked, but they still weren't as strong as I wanted.</p><p>My latest version adds another pair of pins.&nbsp; It's *really* strong and secure when plugged into a breadboard.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/pot1.jpg" style="width: 720px; height: 586px;"></p><p>The PCB is so very simple.</p><p><a href="https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/P38N77nS"><img alt="" src="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/files/images/pot3.png" style="width: 268px; height: 240px;"></a></p><p>They can be <a href="https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/P38N77nS">ordered from OSH Park</a>, if you'd like to have some for your next breadboard-based demo.</p><p>The pot used on these photos is <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?keywords=PTV09A-4020U-B103-ND">Digikey # PTV09A-4020U-B103-ND</a>.&nbsp; This is a very standard pinout for 6mm shaft pots, so many others are likely to work fine.</p><p>The colored knobs were ordered from a no-name Chinese merchant on Ebay.&nbsp; Searching on Ebay for "knob 6mm shaft" will bring up *lots* of them.&nbsp; These gray ones with colored tops were 10 piece for $1, with free shipping.&nbsp; The ones I got didn't actually fit the 6mm shaft until I ran a drill bit into the center, but it's hard to complain when they're so incredibly cheap.</p><p>Best of all, real knobs with bright colors and sturdy construction really invite people to touch and adjust and play with a breadboard constructed demo, in fun ways that just aren't socially feasible with trim pots!</p>
