    My ongoing effort to learn Final Cut Pro X......<object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/BHQPqQ_5ulc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/BHQPqQ_5ulc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><!--break-->Appearing in this video.....Voice-over (hopefully high quality audio), lots of little screw-ups masked or deleted.Titles and graphics overlays, timed the audio trackPicture-in-picture (serial monitor while touching), hopefully in syncEdits between 3 demo tests (direct touch, tape touch, 2 touch styles) and other scenes.  Hopefully they aren't "jump" cuts - had to crop/zoom the 2-touch-style clip to avoid a jump cut to/from.I really wanted to make animated graphics showing the tiny current flow through the 4.7M resistor and gradual voltage increase.  Sadly, that's still far beyond my skills, and maybe I need to buy Motion 5 for that?!
