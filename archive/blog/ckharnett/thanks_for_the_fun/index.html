    <p>HI all from Louisville, Kentucky. I had a great detour from my conference last week at your Monday meeting. Pictures at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/lvl1/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/lvl1/</a>. This year I plan to visit more Dorkbot/hackerspaces on a "dorkabout" to find inspiration. Since November we've been building a local hacker/maker space called LVL1 (website: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.lvl1.org/">http://www.lvl1.org/</a>) which meets every other Tuesday. Next week I will report the vast amount of creativity and energy at DorkbotPDX. The Teensy will get passed on to a deserving LVL1 member and I've seen a couple who are already interested. It's going to be tough to decide!</p>
