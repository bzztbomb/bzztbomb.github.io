Just drop in.</p><p>Description: We all love circuits with blinky lights that make strange noises, but imagine how much cooler your circuits would look on a custom-designed and manufactured circuit board. It's easier than it may seem, and we're going to show you how it's down. Using the free version of EAGLE PCB you can design your own circuit boards in a format that is then easy to have fabricated.</p><p>This is an introductory course on using EAGLE to design printed circuit boards for fabrication. It's aimed at beginners that may have breadboarded some electronics, and now want to make a final circuit board. We'll design a simple circuit, draw out the schematic, and lay out a board.</p><p>Bring a computer: Mac, Linux, or Windows. Please download and install Eagle beforehand from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/downloads/">http://www.cadsoftusa.com/downloads/</a></p><p>Laen, the ever dedicated Dorkbotter behind the DorkbotPDX group PCB order, will be showing you all of the necessary ins and outs so that you, too, can make your very own printed circuit boards.</p>
