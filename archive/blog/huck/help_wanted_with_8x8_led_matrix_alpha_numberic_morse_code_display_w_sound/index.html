  <div id="db-content">
    <p>The IDEA is this:</p><p>taking an 8x8 LED Matrix... having it display a letter in a 5x5 section of the display(top left corner lets say) then displaying below it the corresponding Morse-code - . - where 2 leds == a dash, 1 led == a dot, and then a blank led to separate each dash/dot... then hooking up a small speaker to out put the Morse-code audibly...and scroll through the alphabet and digits 0-9 prefer using a Teensy as it would make a nice smallish package&#160;:)</p><p>Really just need help with how to write the sketch to display the different parts together all at once...</p><p>--Huck</p>
