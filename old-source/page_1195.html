	Features and functionality
		Large-scale examples, including HackRF and Daisho projects
	Background
		Cross platform
		Open source -- contribute! Bugs, documentation, code.
		CERN involvement -- donate!
	Goals for today:
		Know what KiCad can and can't do
		Have some idea how to do basic things
		Where to look for more help

Workflow
	Multiple task-specific "apps" under a shell program
	Project creation
	Schematic capture
		Symbol creation
	Design rules checking
	Netlist generation
	Symbol:Footprint mapping (CVPCB)
