<p>Ok, so here's the scoop: tomorrow night (that's Thursday for those who aren't keeping count) we're going to be getting down for some tried and true geekery at everyone's favorite downtown hacker hangout, Backspace.</p><p>So, bring yourself and your hacked gear down and show off your 1337 skills. We'll be sitting around staring at our monitors until you show up. Be there at 7PM if you want the good seats! Bring a friend or two for bonus points.&#160;;~)</p>
