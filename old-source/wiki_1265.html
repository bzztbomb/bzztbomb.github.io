  I, Mykle be presenting a workshop on FAUST, the digital signal
processing language, this July 10th.  Some of you have already
expressed interest in learning more about this exciting new source
of bleeps and bloops!
<p>
Faust is a functional language for describing signal-processing networks.
It has obvious applications in audio, but also has great potential for
software-defined radio, subatomic physics, or any other situation where
one might want to efficiently analyze streams of information.
<p>
Faust uses a floating-point paradigm that avoids many of the pitfalls of
digitization; it operates on streams of floating point or integer values.
Normalization and digital headroom issues can usually be ignored until
the final output stage.
<p>
The Faust compiler is mathematically deep; it employs Lambda calculus
to analyze and reduce Faust code, producing well-optimized output in
a variety of languages including C, C++ and the LLVM compiler suite.
Researchers at Stanford University&rsquo;s reaped huge gains in the performance
of their Synthesis Toolkit libraries after translating them from
hand-optimized C++ to simpler, high-level Faust!
<p>
Because the entire Stanford Synthesis Toolkit is ported to Faust, there&rsquo;s
a cornucopia of easy to use processors and signal generators available:
oscillators, compressors, filters, translators, delays, simulations of
analog circuits and vacuum tubes, and more.
<p>
I plan to demonstrate Faust in the context of its companion app,
FaustLive, which is an IDE for Faust.  If there&rsquo;s interest, we could
get into how to cross-compile Faust to any of the many different
audio environments it supports: PD, VST, CoreAudio, WebAudio, et
cetera.
<p>
I decided to teach this workshop in order to give myself an excuse
to dive deeper into the language.  I still am by no means an expert
Faust programmer, nor am I a very deep mathematician, or well-schooled
in the higher arts of digital signal processing.  But if I can bring
you all quickly up to my level, I&rsquo;m hoping you can all take it
from there. =) Together we will learn how to construct useful
networks of signal processing components using a functional,
concise and curious text-based language, instead of having to draw
giant diagrams of interconnected black boxes &mdash; although we will get
diagrams too, for free!
<p>
Attendees should bring a laptop with FaustLive installed; I&rsquo;ll provide
installation instructions.  If you&rsquo;re interested, please let me know
your target operating system so I can be sure it&rsquo;s covered.
I also encourage you to bring decent computer speakers if possible,
the better to hear what Faust can do.
