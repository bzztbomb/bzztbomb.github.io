<p><b>When</b>: Friday, July 23rd at 7pm<b>Where</b>: <a href="http://www.backspace.bz">Backspace</a> (<a href="http://bit.ly/97VKyQ">115 Northwest 5th</a>)</p><p>Please join us at Backspace on Friday, July 23rd at 7pm for a Dorkbot PDX summer party!  We will be celebrating the conclusion of <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010">OSCON</a> that week and enjoying some nice geekery.</p><p>We will have an hour or so of OpenDork -- where people get a chance to present on some recent art/tech/dork work in 5 or 10 minutes and solicit feedback from the community.  It's a great chance to see what other hackers have been banging on, and it's a wonderful opportunity to get inspired!</p><p>There will be a couple of musical performances (by people with hand-built music devices) and we will have one or more DJs to round out the night.</p><p>Backspace has generously extended a $1 off draft beer special for the event!  Woot!</p><p>As always, Dorkbot PDX events of this sort are free and open to the  public, so hackity hack and spread the word.  See you there!</p><!--break--><h2>Schedule</h2>The schedule is loose, but we are planning on:<ul><li>8:00-9:00pm - OpenDork</li><li>9:00-11:00pm (+) - Live music</li></ul><h2>OpenDork Demos</h2><ul><li>Cam - off Luz</li><li>Bzztbomb - sekret tiki</li><li>Pam - Tri-color wearable arduino LED belt</li><li>Mathew Lippincott - cellphone reading arduino sensor data into twitter, pachube, and soon drupal&flot</li><li>Jeff Cavener - committed by sekret/undecided</li><li>Steve Davee - something!</li></ul><h2>Performance</h2><ul><li>DJ Normal</li><li>abusive:consumer</li><li>infiltration lab</li><li>jesse mejia</li><li>dalas verdugo</li></ul>
