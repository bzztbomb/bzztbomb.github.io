<p>I'm playing with a FPGA starter kit board and decided to blog about my learning process. I got the board from Jared at <a class="external text" href="http://www.sharebrained.com/" rel="nofollow">Sharebrained</a>, thanks! The board I have is a <a class="external text" href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,799&amp;Prod=S3BOARD" rel="nofollow">Spartan-3 Board</a> from Digilient. It has a Xilinx FPGA on it. It also came with a JTAG-USB cable which could end up be useful with other projects?</p><p>First step is to get a dev environment set up so I can upload example code.</p><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">Contents</span></p><div class="toc" id="toc"><ul><li class="toclevel-1"><a href="#The_steps_are:"><span class="tocnumber">1</span> <span class="toctext">The steps are:</span></a><ul><li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Getting_the_drivers"><span class="tocnumber">1.1</span> <span class="toctext">Getting the drivers</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Finding_the_compiler_which_will_generate_the_binary"><span class="tocnumber">1.2</span> <span class="toctext">Finding the compiler which will generate the binary</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Finding_an_example_to_run_which_will_work_with_my_board"><span class="tocnumber">1.3</span> <span class="toctext">Finding an example to run which will work with my board</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Uploading_the_example"><span class="tocnumber">1.4</span> <span class="toctext">Uploading the example</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-2"><a href="#Random_stuff_I.27ve_learned:"><span class="tocnumber">1.5</span> <span class="toctext">Random stuff I've learned:</span></a></li></ul></li></ul></div><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">The steps are:</span></p><ol><li>Getting drivers for the JTAG cable</li><li>Finding the compiler which will generate the binary</li><li>Finding an example to run which will work with my board</li><li>Uploading the example</li></ol><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_the_drivers">Getting the drivers</span></h3><p>Grab the drivers for the JTAG-USB cable <a class="external text" href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Catalog.cfm?NavPath=2,66&amp;Cat=12" rel="nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp; This also contains the software you need to load binaries onto the board.&nbsp; It is called Adept.&nbsp; This is painless as long as the USB hub you are plugging into is actually powered on. ;)</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Finding_the_compiler_which_will_generate_the_binary">Finding the compiler which will generate the binary</span></h3><p>Download the WebPack from <a class="external text" href="http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
