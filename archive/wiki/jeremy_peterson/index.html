I currently live in NW Portland and my interests include Art, Music, Photography, Short Film, Programming, Robots and a few other things I try to make time for. Recently, I've been leaning towards programing and robotics, specifically with the Arduino platform.I also have a <a href="http://4volt.com/" target="new">website</a> to document that random assortment of projects. The majority of my projects are "open" and available for public download, so check it out if you have a few minutes at <a href="http://4volt.com/" target="new">4volt.com</a>I'm always interested in collaborating on projects, let me know if you have an idea!
