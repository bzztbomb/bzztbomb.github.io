    <p>To take advantage of the Benito's small size, I've zapped mine with a piece of software that, when plugged into a computer, causes the mouse to jump about randomly.</p><p>The size of the jitter can be adjusted by setting the "STEP" constant. 10 seems to be a pretty good number to make it seem like there's something wrong with your mouse. Anything larger, and it's pretty obvious that you're being messed with.</p>
