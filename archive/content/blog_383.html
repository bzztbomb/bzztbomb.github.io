I built this little midi controller to trigger samples and control a few Pd parameters:

I posted a video of this in late May, but now that I've had a chance to document a few things, there is <a href="http://www.noisybox.net/electronics/dickhole_keypiss/">more information online</a>.

It's based on an old touchtone telephone keypad, a rotary encoder, a two digit LED display, and a USB-based AVR breakout board (the <a href="http://pjrc.com/teensy"/>Teensy++</a>).  The PC board was hand-etched at home, and it's mounted in a solid white, repurposed jewelry or makeup box, purchased at the Goodwill.

We used this both at <a href='http://toorcamp.org'>toorcamp</a> and at the Someday Lounge performance thing on July 17th.
