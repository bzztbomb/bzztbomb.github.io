A month or so I suggested what I thought would be a one-day project. I asked my colleagues at the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Main_Page">Indie Web Camp</a> to create the Smallest Federated Wiki. The idea was that wiki would be simpler if I kept my pages and you kept yours. Somehow we'd share pages through some sort of "refactoring" browser. Well, the prototype is working and showing well. I invite you to watch the 2-4 minute screencasts I've posted on my new <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/wiki">Wiki Channel</a> on vimeo. Here is the introduction.
