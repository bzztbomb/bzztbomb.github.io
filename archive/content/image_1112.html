<p>I built a version of the ByteBeats circuit with a Teensy-3.1 I had on hand.&nbsp; It works the same as the Teensy-2.0 versions, but it probably has a higher top frequency.&nbsp; (Doesn't matter, I can't hear that high anyway.)</p><p>I also updated the program to be able to play regular notes instead of the crazy one-line-of-code melodies that we used during the workshop.</p><p>Thanks to everybody who participated; I hope you all had fun &amp; learned something.&nbsp; Don't forget, you can use the same circuit to do a lot of other audio things as well.</p>
