<p>Bootstrap yourself into conviviality by writing your own Forth</p><p>David Frech 2008 March 30 DorkbotPDX 0x01</p><hr /><p>This talk is dedicated to all Makers.</p><p>"We make in order to know."</p><p>Making creates knowledge in our bodies. We are wired to do it. It is a key part of being human.</p><p>The world of made objects is an inexhaustible source of inspiring &amp; intoxicating beauty.</p><hr /><p>What do these terms mean? What do we mean by</p><ul><li>Forth</li><li>Bootstrapping</li><li>Conviviality</li></ul><hr /><p>What is Forth?</p><ul><li>Forth aphorism: "Forth isn't a language, it's an environment."</li><li>My response: Forth is an idea, not a language.</li></ul><ul><li>Forth aphorism: "If you've seen one Forth, you've seen one Forth."</li><li>Reality: simplicity &amp; extensibility create a tower of Babel</li></ul><hr /><p>Concretely, what is Forth?</p><ul><li>Trivial syntax: whitespace-separated tokens</li><li>Trivial compiler: words are simply sequenced</li><li>Two stacks: allows words to consume and generate</li></ul><p>variable numbers of arguments</p><ul><li>Everything is executable</li><li>Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)</li></ul><pre>   * tokens are simply executed left-to-right</pre><p>* Dictionary - two senses: * the "heap" - all the words and their data * the association of tokens with their code</p><hr /><p>What is bootstrapping?</p><p>* Originally, idea of pulling yourself up, off the ground, by pulling on your bootstraps.</p><p>* Needs an "external input of energy"</p><p>* Examples: * booting Linux * creating a new Forth by meta-compiling * creating an "application" by extending Forth (incremental bootstrap)</p><p>* Meta-circular * Self-referential * Recursive</p><hr /><p>What is conviviality? What are convivial tools?</p><p>* Ivan Illich, _Tools for conviviality_ a critique/postscript for the industrial age</p><p>* E F Schumacher's _Small is beautiful_ is similar</p><p>* Convivial&#160;!= easy to learn or use well</p><p>* Alan Kay: pencil as mundane computing device</p><p>* Industry can stifle conviviality while creating convivial tools (MCUs are a good example here)</p><p>* Human languages are convivial. Why aren't most computer languages?</p><p>* Conviviality as a measure (index of liberation)</p><hr /><p>Forth is simple but powerful. Why is this?</p><p>* Code being read in can affect the parser &amp; compiler</p><p>* Trivial parser and compiler are easy to modify &amp; "misuse"</p><p>* "Writing the reader" - a trait shared with Lisp &amp; Smalltalk</p><p>* Live system - all of Forth available, all the time</p><p>* Extensible via colon words, code words, and new data types</p><hr /><p>A brief history of Forth</p><p>* Chuck Moore invents (some say "discovers") Forth * polyFORTH * fig-FORTH * ANS * colorForh</p><hr /><p>Where is the Forth community?</p><p>* A dead language? * No good books available * SVFIG a disappointment * Implementors have moved on</p><p>* gforth is a good implementation, but big and unapproachable - and ANS.</p><p>* Chuck continues to innovate, but his work is inaccessible, literally and figuratively</p><hr /><p>Why muFORTH?</p><p>* It all started with fig-FORTH (ca 1980)</p><p>* dforth (ca 1997) * assembler, tied to Linux, hard to modify, hard to understand</p><p>* Once again, we make in order to know. I wanted a platform for experiments, a substrate for building target compilers for MCUs</p><p>* muFORTH, native-coded (ca 2002) * trivial compiler * tail-recursive * even a trivial compiler can be hard to port</p><p>* muFORTH, indirect-threaded (ca 2005) * slower but portable * a simpler model of Forth</p><hr /><p>muFORTH's innovations</p><p>* hybrid of C &amp; Forth * self-bootstrap * no numbers * no control structures * no data types</p><p>* token consumers * simplicity of creating new interpreter "modes"</p><hr /><p>Sources &amp; resources</p><p>muFORTH git clone <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="git://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth.git">git://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth.git</a> browse <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master">http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master</a></p><p>Tools for conviviality <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://clevercycles.com/tools_for_conviviality/">http://clevercycles.com/tools_for_conviviality/</a> (hard to read; style to be narrower)</p><p>colorForth <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.colorforth.com/">http://www.colorforth.com/</a></p><p>HOPL Forth history paper <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.colorforth.com/HOPL.html">http://www.colorforth.com/HOPL.html</a></p><p>Brad Rodriguez's (good) Forth implementation articles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/index.html">http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/index.html</a></p><p>Brad's CamelForth <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://camelforth.com/news.php">http://camelforth.com/news.php</a></p><hr /><p><br /></p>
