Adventures in Etching - The test pattern

I made a test pattern to determine what my etching capabilities actually are:

This one is a bit better than my <a href="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/blog/laen/experimenting_with_toner_transfer">last one</a>.  It's smaller (2x2 inches vs. 5x4 inches) so you don't waste as much board, has test points, and a bunch more common surface mount components.

My method was:
* Print to magazine paper.
* Transfer to copper using 12 trips through the laminator.
* Etch in a muriatic acid / hydrogen peroxide bath.
* Remove toner with acetone.

Here's the final result:
Board 1: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/3579108318/" title="Etched Board #1 by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2450/3579108318_c884fda47e.jpg" width="500" height="471" alt="Etched Board #1" /></a>

The 8 mil trace is good!

Board 2:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/3579107328/" title="Etched Board #2 by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3579107328_4c5d40632e.jpg" width="500" height="460" alt="Etched Board #2" /></a>

Only the 10 mil trace and higher are good.
