<p>Straightforward ATmega328 Peripheral Controller Board via Laen's combined PCB order. Arduino-ish, though 20MHz. Isolated power supplies for logic and servo/peripheral outputs. No SMD, but then, this is my first.</p>
<p>Eagle CAD schematic and board <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://autonomoustools.com/blog/2010/10/29/pcb-release-peripheral-driver">GPL'd and GitHub'd</a>.</p>
<p>Not likely to appear at the Portland meet-ups, I'm afraid: bit of a drive from the Midwest.</p>
