<p>If anyone has any experience using these two items or coding for them I would be very grateful for any advice you might be able to give. I am currently working on a project and bought an arduino and a couple of micro controllers from pololu thinking that the coding would be fine and that I would be able to do it. Unfortunately I have not been able to get it working. I can get servos to work directly from the arduino but I have about 30 servos to control currently and so I have to hook up a couple of controllers to get this to work correctly. Any help would be appreciated. I just want to get them connected properly so that I can start writing the program I want them to utilize.</p>
<p>Thanks chris</p>
