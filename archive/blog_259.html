<p>Yet another thing I scavenged from Wacky Willy's. At the time he was selling the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wgz.org/bwarden/hacks/teddyr/">Teddy Ruxpin Display units</a>, and I thought maybe these were part of the display unit interface. Frankly, I don't have a clue. If anyone has suggestions on what to do with them, or if you want one, I have 4 available (free).</p>
<p>I've looked up the assembly number and the 2 big chips, but have come up empty on both.</p>
