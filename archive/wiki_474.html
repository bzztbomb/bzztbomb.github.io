This is general wiki space for dorkbotpdx pure data information sharing

First off - thanks to everyone who came out to our workshop last Sunday
http://dorkbotpdx.org/workshop/pd/2-interfacing_with_the_world!

<strong>***we will have an open lab at PNCA on Sunday March 28th. bring your project and questions!***</strong>

Jason posted a blog entry with two of the patches from the workshop <a href= "http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/blog/breedx/pd_patches_from_the_workshop">here</a>

We will update this page soon with new Midi Monster firmware, instructions for loading it onto your hardware - as well as information about wiring pots and more patches.

Please feel free to add your own notes/thoughts/links to this page. If you've been physically interacting with PD since the workshop - please share!


Here's an interesting link I found - it builds a little bit on the simple sampler patch Alex demonstrated. A grid of buttons hooked into the midi monster would make a nice interface for something like this:
