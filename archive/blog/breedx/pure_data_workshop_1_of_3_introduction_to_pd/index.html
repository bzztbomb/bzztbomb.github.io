It is the third majorbranch of the family of patcher programming languages known as Max(Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) originally developed byMiller Puckette and company at IRCAM."</p><p>Pure Data is free [FLOSS] software - meaning there is no charge forthe download and it is open source, (free/libre). It runs wonderfullyon Mac, Linux, Windows - so bring any laptop. Come with Pd-extendedinstalled if possible - otherwise come a little early for installationassistance. The workshop is free as well!</p><p>We will will be doing several workshops starting from the ground up -and ranging topics as advanced as there is interest for.</p><p>Workshop One will be held May 17th. No prior Pd or programmingknowledge is required, but expect to leave with functional knowledgeof how to use Pd. The outline in progress can be found here:<a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pd_workshop_2009_outline">http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pd_workshop_2009_outline</a>.</p><p>But we want to hear from you! We'd love to get a rough idea of howmany people are interested in attending.</p><p>Do you use Pd? Do you use similar commercial software like Max/MSP? Are you interested in learning Pd? Why? What are some of your ideas?</p><p>Pd is an incredibly open-ended platform so we're trying to get an ideaof where the majority's (if there is a majority) interests lie....Physical Interfaces for music? Live DSP? Generative composition?Video? Dance? Robotic cat toys? Feedforward most welcome!</p><p>Bring a laptop with Pd-extended installed, if possible. Otherwise comea little early for installation help!  <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads">http://puredata.info</a>.</p><p style='font-weight: bold'>Seating is limited to about 35, so please rsvp at http://dorkbotpdx.org/pd_rsvp or email jason@noisybox_net or coldham@mac_com.</p><ul><li>When: May 17th, 2009</li><li>Where: PNCA room 205 (Portland, OR)</li><li>Time: 1-5pm</li></ul>
