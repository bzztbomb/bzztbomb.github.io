Success with DorkBoard

<p>I attended the Arduino Cult Induction on Sunday (Jan 25). It went pretty well.</p>
<p>A couple notes:</p>
<p>1) Dang, those chip resistors are small! I'm glad I brought a magnifying glass and tweezers.</p>
<p>2) You can build 'boy' or 'girl' versions of the Dorkboard -- with pins for prototyping (boys) or with sockets for simple connection to other hardware (girls). Only they don't call them boy or girl (yet). The top illustration at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/workshop/arduino/cult_induction_rev4">cult_induction_rev4</a> shows one built with sockets, while the bottom illustration shows pins. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/dorkboard_assembly_tutorial">assembly tutorial</a> shows the pins version.</p>
<p>3) The connection to the serial port for Arduino programming is recommended female connector. This only matters if you're building more than one dorkboard and/or you want to share the serial adapter with others.</p>
<p>4) The benito.inf (Windows configuration file had a mismatch for one character -- a 'B' should have been a '4'. Copy/paste the inf, and tweak the line as described in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/blog/feurig/january_induction_followup">followup</a>. With that change, the Arduino IDE works great for Windows XP and Windows 2000.</p>
