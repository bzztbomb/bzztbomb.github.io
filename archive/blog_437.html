<p>Feurig taught a great Eagle PCB workshop this weekend and had a solid turnout with a bunch of fast-learning board hackers! Kudos!</p>
<p>As Feurig was about to place a pizza order, an utterly surreal and beautifully sarcastic moment happened. This is the exchange...</p>
<p><b>feurig:</b> Is anyone here a vegetarian or vegan?<br />
<b>&lt;crickets chirping in silence&gt;</b><br />
<b>me:</b> wow, that's gotta be a first in Portland workshop history!<br />
<b>mykle:</b> well, I'm allergic to starches!<br />
<b>heckler#2:</b> I'm allergic to carbon!<br />
<b>&lt;laugh riot&gt;</b></p>
<p>And really, the cadence was just perfect. I just absolutely had to share the LOL for those who weren't there. &#160;;)</p>
