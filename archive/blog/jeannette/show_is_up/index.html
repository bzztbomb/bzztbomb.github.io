    <p>Hey, if any of you are in the north Vancouver area this afternoon, I invite you to come to my opening reception for my show! Thanks for the feedback, I can't wait to use dorkboards in my next project. It'll give me a lot more freedom.</p><p>Here's the show press release -- for the first time in my life, I got tweeted! Obviously it's a big, big day &#160;:)</p><p>"Objects from the Museum of Family" on display at WSU Vancouver</p><p>VANCOUVER, Wash. -Jeannette Altman, artist, instructional technician in fine arts at Washington State University Vancouver and an instructor at Clark College, is showing an exhibit of her artwork at WSU Vancouver in the Administration building gallery Sept.14 - Nov. 2. "Objects from the Museum of Family" is based on images and stories from Altman's own family history.</p><p>Altman is fascinated with her family genealogy. Her artwork shows images of her ancestors and objects from the past in an installation that includes light and sound. The modern technology creates ambiance for the antiquated images on display.</p><p>"I'm interested in what changes and doesn't, how lights can give the thrum of life to an otherwise inanimate landscape. I'm interested in sound and smell and how they can trigger a memory. I think human beings can create the most beautiful objects, sometimes just by the power of owning them," said Altman.</p><p>Altman will speak about her work Thursday, Sept. 17 from 4 - 6 p.m. in the Administration building gallery. Community members are invited to meet Altman and talk about her artwork. For more information, contact Erin Dengerink Madarang, WSU Vancouver gallery director, at madarang@vancouver.wsu.edu, or 360-546-9551.</p><p>WSU Vancouver art galleries are open from 8 a.m. - 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. Friday.
