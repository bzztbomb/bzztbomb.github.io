<div><p>I’ve been meaning to document my work on this project for about year now. TBA 2014 reminded me it is time to actually do it! So here it is:</p><p>For the past year and a half I’ve been working with a dance company called <a href="http://bobbevy.com/">bobbevy</a>. I’ve been creating graphics that go along with the dance performance called “This is how we disappear”. Here’s a <a href="http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/culturephile-portland-arts/articles/tba-bobbevy-september-2013">review</a> at Portland Monthly.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/109031415" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/109031415">This is how we disappear - projection edit</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user751962">Brian Richardson</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More behind the scenes information after the break!</p><!--break--><p><a href="http://www.anestheticaudio.com/">Jesse Meija</a> was doing music and got me involved with this project, I’m very grateful!</p><h2>Version 1</h2><p>Effects for the first set of performances:</p><ul><li>A forest of trees created from a drawings by <a href="http://www.davidestein.com/">David Stein</a>.</li><li>Particle effects that mimiced the dancers movement.</li><li>Particle effects that just fly across the screen</li></ul><p>In order to accomplish this, I wrote a piece of software that would do the animation and handle tracking the dancers. There were two versions, the first version was used to perform a few times. Notably <a href="http://www.conduit-pdx.org/dance+.html">Dance+</a> in 2012 and as part of <a href="https://vimeo.com/65824287">Experimental Half Hour XXXVII</a>. It consisted of the following pieces:</p><ul><li><a href="http://libcinder.org">Cinder</a>, used as a framework</li><li><a href="http://openkinect.org/">Freenect</a>, used to interface to the Microsoft Kinect.</li><li><a href="http://charlie-roberts.com/Control/">Control</a>, used to control the software from an iPad</li></ul><p>This version worked ok. Before I started using Control, I had been triggering all of the sequences with keyboard commands. It worked fine, but I had to have a cheatsheet that told me what keys did what. Also, each command just mutated the state of the program, so if you triggered things in a different order you’d end up in different states. This made some rehersals hard, because it was difficult to return the graphics to a previous state. However, with Control, it became easier to use the software. bobbevy performed in Milwaukee without me and was able to use the software just fine! For Dance+ the Kinect refused to work in the studio, I think because the temperature in the room was so high. So I ended up “drawing” the dancers with a multi-touch interface in Control.</p><p>For the particle effects that followed the dancers, I ended up using blob tracking and distingugishing blobs based on distance away from the Kinect. I liked the stateless design because the dancers would move in and out of view of the Kinect and I feel that keeping track of them properly would have been a nightmare. This created some surprising benefits though. The swarms move between the dancer when their relationship to the Kinect changes and it created some really nice animations. Also, this piece has a lot of tension between the dancers and the particles ended up expressing some tension when the dancers were about the same distance away from the Kinect.</p><h2>Version 2</h2><p>Additional effects for the second set of performances:</p><ul><li>Static/simple projection mapped screens (similar to my <a href="http://bzztbomb.com/blog/2013/01/06/party-house/">Party House</a> project).</li><li>Realtime projection mapped patterns on the dancers bodies</li></ul><p>This second version of the software was used to perform at <a href="http://www.ontheboards.org/performances/nw-new-works-festival-2013/">NW New Works Festival 2013</a> and at <a href="http://pica.org/event/tba13/">TBA 2013</a>.</p><p>For the second version of the software, I used the following new pieces:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/q-depot/QTimeline">QTimeline</a>, this is a timeline that allows one to control tweens of variables</li><li><a href="http://www.keithmcmillen.com/QuNeo/tour">QuNeo</a>, as much as I liked Control using a touchscreen while not looking at it (I had to look at the dancers for my cues!) is not ideal. A physical controller allows you to rest you finger on the button/slider you need to push without triggering it. (The cool kids pronounce it keeen-wah).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/meshula/LabMidi">LabMidi</a>, used to interface to the QuNeo</li><li>For TBA, 3, yes 3! Projectors. Two of them were used to cover the wide background, and one was used to project onto the dancers themselves.</li></ul><p>The timeline solved many problems for me. It took what I used to have hard code in the application (fade times, animation speed, etc) and moved it to a data format. The editing GUI was nice to have as well. A new version of Cinder that made using multiple displays easier to use was really nice to have as well. I didn’t need to mirror my desktop screen anymore, which meant I could display debug and other helpful info on my screen. The QuNeo also allowed me to directly control ramp parameters which meant I didn’t need to rely on predetermined fades as much. This also allowed me to be more engaged with the visuals which was really fun. I think the trick to this will be finding the right balance between direct control and triggers to presets. It is probably the same balance electronic musicians search for.</p><p>The newest effect for the second run was the projection mapped dancers. In order to accomplish this, I was going to have to find the dancers with the Kinect and then project onto them as close as possible. I used the vvvv patch from <a href="http://www.kimchiandchips.com/blog/?p=725">here</a> as a starting point to learn how to calibrate my projector with the Kinect. In the end, I wrote my own calibration code because it fit the setup workflow a bit better.</p><p>The projection mapped dancers worked pretty well. I was really excited to see them turn into just an indistigushable mass at moments and then turn back into dancers the next. I think this is what projection mapping should do: transform objects and confuse you, then bring you back to reality. I hope to do more of this in the future!</p><p>Cross posted from <a href="http://bzztbomb.com/blog/2014/10/15/this-is-how-we-disappear/">my blog.</a></p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>
