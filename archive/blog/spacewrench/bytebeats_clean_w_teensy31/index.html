    <p>Here's a clean version of the ByteBeats circuit we built last Sunday.&nbsp; I used a Teensy-3.1 instead of a Teensy-2.0, but everything else is more-or-less the same.&nbsp; (I added some capacitors on the power lines, a volume control and a speaker instead of the headphones, but it's all minor changes that anybody at a Dorbot meeting could help you with.&nbsp; Or email me, I'll go through it with you.)</p><p>The ByteBeats workshop went pretty well: everybody left with a working circuit, although there were some hiccups along the way.</p><p>I hope you all enjoyed the project.&nbsp; Keep in mind: the same circuit can be used for a bunch of different audio hackery by changing the software.&nbsp; For example, I wrote a program to produce sine waves at regular musical-scale intervals.&nbsp; It's a short step from there to playing MIDI, I imagine.</p><p><img src="/files/images/TeensyMusicBox.preview.jpg"></p><p><!--break--></p><p>I also cleaned up the hairball circuit my kid built at the workshop.&nbsp; Turns out, there's enough room on those mini breadboards to fit a Teensy-2, DAC, amp, <i>and</i> an optoisolator that will work for MIDI-IN.&nbsp; So the next thing to do is see if I can hook this up to an old Yamaha keyboard I have and see if I can get the Teensy to play the sounds for it.</p><p><img src="/files/images/T2ByteBeats.jpg"></p><p><i>Edit:</i> Turns out the answer is "yes, yes you can use the Teensy to generate audio for MIDI data sent from a Yamaha keyboard."  But the keyboard is much more capable and in tune!</p>
