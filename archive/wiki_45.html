<p>Basically I want to make some qr code paintings/drawings for an exhibit. I have a short deadline and I am really picky about my aesthetics. I need someone to help me create specific qr codes that point to specific urls, pretty places on the net. I have a lot of ideas but not much tech knowledge. I am obsessed with visual imagery and I have lots of pretty toys, would love assistance with this project. I can post some links to ideas.</p>
