<p>I feel like I should set a good example here and start blogging to the new site, but, on the other hand, I already have a much <a class="external text" href="http://opposable-thumbs.net" rel="nofollow">neglected blog</a>. So... do I start posting things here, too? Do I cross post (damn, wouldn't that get confusing)? Need to get that aggregator to pul content into the front page... that would solve some problems.</p>
