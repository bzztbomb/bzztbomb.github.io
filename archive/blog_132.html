I recently acquired a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=683">tri-color LED Matrix display</a> from <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun</a>.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laen/2392741241/" title="SparkFun Tri-Color Dot Matrix Display by Laen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2328/2392741241_c1590b62a2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="SparkFun Tri-Color Dot Matrix Display" /></a>

I bought it "bare" (with no controller), for the challenge of setting it up, and I'm finally getting around to doing it. 

The first challenge was figuring out the pinout.  The <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/FYM-23881ABxxx.pdf">datasheet</a> was, er.. "unclear".

Here's what I've figured out:

(R,G,B)

Cathodes --
Column 1 - (32, 2, 1)
Column 2 - (3, 30, 31)
Column 3 - (29, 5, 4)
Column 4 - (6, 27, 28)
Column 5 - (12, 22, 11)
Column 6 - (20, 13, 21)
Column 7 - (15, 19, 14)
Column 8 - (17, 16, 18)

Anodes -- 
Row 1 - 26
Row 2 - 25
Row 3 - 24
Row 4 - 23
Row 5 - 10
Row 6 - 9
Row 7 - 8
Row 8 - 7

So, to turn on the red LED on Row 4, Column 5, you'd need to give power to pin 22 and sink pin 23.

I think the best way to do this is with four 74HC595 shift registers, thirty-two 2n3904 transistors, and 8 current limiting resistors.

I just hope I can shift out 24 bytes of information  quickly enough that there's no flicker.

<b>Update, 4/08/08 --</b>
So, my first attempt was a bit of a failure. for two reasons:
* I thought the rows were cathodes and the columns were anodes.   Turns out I had it backwards, and had already soldered in all my transistors onto the board.
* I have never soldered on perfboard before, and thought I'd be able to bridge the pads easily with solder.  Not so.  Not so at all.

So, I could continue on this board, soldering down 100 little wires that don't want to be soldered down, or start afresh with a new board.  I'm going to do the latter.

Or maybe I'll do my very first PCB?
