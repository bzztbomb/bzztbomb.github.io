So you can control your project from your phone with a nice UI! Meaning you can get your project running faster because you don't have to create a full hardware UI for your project. We'll get the Arduino IDE up and running and try a few different programming options.  We'll be programming the NodeMcu. This is a beginner class.</p><p>Instructor: Thomas Hudson</p><p>Sunday November 13th, Noon to 3pm at</p><p>Ctrl-H, 7608 N.
