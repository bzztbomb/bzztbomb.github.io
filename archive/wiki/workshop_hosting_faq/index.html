The topic should be strongly or loosely related to "People Doing Strange Things With Electricity", and it should concerned with technology, art, or preferably some inspiring combination of the two.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_Who_can_host_a_workshop.3F">Q: Who can host a workshop?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A:_Anybody.2A">A: Anybody*</span></h2><p>(*)Well, mostly. We expect you to have been to at least a meeting or few and have interacted with the group at large. Attendance of other prior <a class="external text" href="/wiki/workshops" rel="nofollow">DorkbotPDX workshops</a> is highly encouraged!</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_Where.2Fwhen_can_we_host_it.3F">Q: Where/when can we host it?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A:_It_depends...">A: It depends...</span></h2><p>The last Sunday of the each month from 1-5pm has become a DorkbotPDX historical standard. We are not married to this, but nerds have come to expect it and it seems to work well for a lot of people.</p><p>We are currently working with <a class="external text" href="http://www.adxportland.com/" rel="nofollow">ADX</a> for most of our workshops, and have arrangements for the aforementioned time slot. Due to logistical considerations, this must be scheduled with the DorkbotPDX workshop coordinator (Senor Horn), steering committee, or admins.</p><p>Other venues are awesome, and we encourage you to help us find some. Your basement or garage is also a possibility, as are public spaces. Help us find what works best!</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_How_many_people_will_come.3F">Q: How many people will come?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A:_Again.2C_it_depends...">A: Again, it depends...</span></h2><p>We've had workshops ranging from 2-45 people. The attendance will depend on the cost, topic zeitgeist, promotion, the weather, and a handful of other random factors.</p><p>We believe that ADX can fit 15-20 people comfortably. If you believe that the workshop may fill up or sell out, you should include an RSVP process (it's actually very helpful!). Please try to accommodate as many people as you can logistically.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_Is_there_a_projector.2Famplifier.2Fwhiteboard.2Fwebcast.3F">Q: Is there a projector/amplifier/whiteboard/webcast?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A:_Probably.3F_Maybe.3F">A: Probably? Maybe?</span></h2><p>I don't know the answer to this for ADX, but we've had them in the past (like at PNCA).</p><p>If you need any of those, please ask and the group can try to make it work.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_Can_I_make_money.3F">Q: Can I make money?</span></h2><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_Can_I_promote_my_product.3F">Q: Can I promote my product?</span></h2><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_Should_I_charge_a_fee.3F">Q: Should I charge a fee?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A:_Yes...but....">A: Yes...but....</span></h2><p>We like free. The spirit of the DorkbotPDX workshops should preclude any notable corporate/personal financial gain.</p><p>You may charge a reasonable fee to recover your personal parts costs, and you should strive to make this fee transparent (ie. publish a full BOM). It's also reasonable to charge a nominal fee for your time (soldering boards, preparing materials, etc), but this should be used conservatively.</p><p>If your personal costs are manageable, please consider a sliding scale and/or a donation system.</p><p>If your workshop is hosted at ADX, there will be a $5/attendee charge, so please take that into consideration.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Q:_How_do_dorkbot_workshops_get_promoted.3F">Q: How do dorkbot workshops get promoted?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A:_By_you.21">A: By you!</span></h2><pre>We are a grassroots organization, so everything we do is done by a member who steps up.</pre><p>There is no single person in charge of promoting, and no single person in charge of this website/wiki. If you don't have an login to create and edit pages on this website yet - just ask someone who does and we'll get you setup!</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Helpful_tips_on_how_promote_your_workshop:">Helpful tips on how promote your workshop:</span></h2><ul><li>Post a blog entry on this site and sticky it so it will be prominent on the front page.
