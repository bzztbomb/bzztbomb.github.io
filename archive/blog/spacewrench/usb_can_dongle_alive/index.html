    <p>Well, that's two for two! The other board Laen fabbed for me was a USB-CAN dongle based on a Luminary LM3S5732 processor. I stuffed it this morning and spent a couple hours reviving my JTAG setup this evening so that I could load code. It's a little fiddly and I don't understand why, but I have blinky code running now. Gotta dig out that old USB code I wrote next and see how bad the bit rot is...</p>
