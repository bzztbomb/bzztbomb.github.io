    <p>After two years of service my outdoor air temperature sensor blinked out last week. Moisture was the culprit as shown here:</p><p><img alt='img' src='/files/images/photo.preview.JPG'/></p><p>Various readouts in my SensorServer system lead me straight to the problem through a half-dozen layers of software. How cool is that?</p><p>Honestly, I'm more interested in how we know and trust complex measurements than knowing the temperature outside.</p><p>My SensorServer software worked so well that I prepared a Keynote presentation explaining each diagnostic step along the way. I meant to post it here, but damn, low battery led Keynote to throw away my presentation. That makes Apple the weak link, no?</p><p>I see a lot of broken systems in our future. A robust world will depend more on diagnosis and recovery than on the out-of-the-box usability that has made Apple famous.</p>
