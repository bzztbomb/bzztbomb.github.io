<p>Just in time for the next cult induction! The through hole USB Arduino lives, and now I have proof that's not just a thumbnail of a photo. It took putting together and testing my new USBtinyISP to finally sit down and take a better photo (you appreciate the PIC USB interface on-board after that) of my NyanCat sketch on the Nokia 5110 display.</p>
<p>A few edits and I might make my first post to Vimeo later tonight. Don, feel free to use this photo and the impending footage on Suspect Device's Etsy page or anywhere else. I think it's better quality.</p>
