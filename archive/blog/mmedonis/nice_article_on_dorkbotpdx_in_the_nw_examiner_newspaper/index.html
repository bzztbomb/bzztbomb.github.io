    <p>I just received my copy of the NW Examiner newspaper in today's mail, and they have a nice article on us on page 18. There was a reporter at a meeting a couple weeks ago, asking a lot of questions, and I was wondering if it would turn into a full article. She certainly did turn it into a full article, covering a lot of different folks' projects and backstories.</p><p>There is a nice photo, too, with a lot of the DorkBot regulars and various technoledgey bits visible. An anecdote from Ward made it in, and Sean and Josh's BrewTroller is covered in the text, and Allan's MakerBot.</p><p>We are wicked famous, man.</p>
