<p>It's on like DONKEY KONG!</p>
<p>A group of like-minded dorkbot people will be conducting a casual social experiment over drinks at Vendetta at 7:30pm on Wednesday, 11/07.</p>
<p>Have you been thinking about coming to a dorkbot meeting but were afraid that your pocket protector was too small? Maybe you're interested in soldering up some LEDs to your theremin and controlling it all by dancing on a glass and metal grid upon which there are realtime video projections of youtube and google maps mashups of arduino powered mind control and hypnotic audio circuits? Maybe you smiled just a little too much the last time you got shocked......</p>
<p>We'll be there, geeking out. You should come. It'll be fun!</p>
<p>Even though this is a casual environment (no powerpoint), you're certainly welcome to bring a project or circuit or schematic or toy or computer or microcontroller for the enjoyment of the group!</p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
