<p>Well I got the boards made and they work!!! The first dorkboard I made has a cap(104) on the dtr line right on the dorkboard, but I designed the adapter to allow me to put the cap on the adapter... and just jumper the spot on the dorkboard.</p>
<p>Feurigs idea is great too, I could leave the extra cap on the dorkboard for dtr... and put a diode on the adapter for self powered boards...</p>
<p>I got some other boards made up to.. I'll post em soon.</p>
