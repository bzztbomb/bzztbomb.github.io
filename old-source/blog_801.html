<p>Sunday has been a hot day in Portland. I know for a fact that it is even hotter in the community garden shed where Russell and I installed Wikiduino today.</p>

<p>I've described our good luck <a href="/w/index.php?title=Remote_Sensing_with_Federated_Wiki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Remote Sensing with Federated Wiki (page does not exist)">creating conectivity</a> in a previous post. Now I'm excited to have real data wrapped in wiki pages streaming from a version 1.0 Arduino program. I upgraded to the 1.0 beta 3 version to use Paul Stoffregen's implementation of Strings. Thanks Paul. And thanks again to Staple Master Russell Senior for helping me pull cables and making them look neat. Thanks Russell.</p>

<p>Thanks also to Gretchen Keehn who completely understands both geeks and vegetables. She's patiently measured her experimental cotton plants with a ruler, at my suggestion, while waiting for my automation to come to life. The poster behind Wikiduino appeals to her authority as a garden founder and includes a QR-Code that links back here to DorkbotPDX where startled gardeners can get a hint as to what is going on.</p>
