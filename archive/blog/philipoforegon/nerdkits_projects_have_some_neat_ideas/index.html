  <div id="db-content">
    <p>the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nerdkits.com/projects/">NerdKits</a> website has some interesting projects and tutorials.</p><p>It's a bit lower-level than <a href='http://arduino.cc'>Arduino</a> projects, but it looks like they've got significant helpful detail. In addition, they've got tutorials which show how to interface external computers (IPhone, web servers) to your Arduino.</p><p>I learned something helpful from their "How to Strip Wire" and "Valentine's Day LED Heart" tutorials.</p>
