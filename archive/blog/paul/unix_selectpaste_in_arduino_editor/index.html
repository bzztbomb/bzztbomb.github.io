<p>The Arduino IDE editor's lack of support for X11's select-paste mechanism has always annoyed me.&nbsp; Well, <a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/pull/1374">I finally got around to adding it</a>.&nbsp; Especially for helping people with their Arduino troubles (which I do every day), it's so very nice to finally be able to quickly select-paste between Arduino and forum messages, email, terminal windows, etc.</p><p>This is a Unix/X11 feature.&nbsp; Mac &amp; Windows do not have anything similar.&nbsp; But on Linux it's so very fast and convenient.&nbsp; This tiny little feature really makes me happy.&nbsp; :-)</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Arduino 1.0.5 now has this feature on Linux.&nbsp; It's not mentioned in the release notes, but if you try select-paste, it now works properly even without installing Teensyduino.</p><p><!--break--></p>
