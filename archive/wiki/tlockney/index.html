<p>I pretty much live on my laptop and get by writing software for some shoe company out in the westside burbs, but I dream of turning my technical talent to artistic pursuits. Maybe that's why I founded DorkbotPDX. I'm hoping being around others who are doing the types of crazy things I always dream up will push me to actually implementing more of it.</p><p>I'm supported by my amazing wife and the greatest dogs you'll ever meet.
