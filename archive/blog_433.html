Now's your chance to get that design you've been working on professionally fabricated in the USA. 


This is open to DorkbotPDX dorks, Make:PDX makers, OpenTechSpace hackers, and anyone else that wants in on it.  Orders must be received by December 10th, and will be distributed by December 21st. 

=== What you get ===
  - Three 2 layer boards (see design rules below)
  - Soldermask on both sides
  - Silkscreen on the top side only.

=== The Costs ===
$3 square inch for three copies of your board.   So, a 2 square inch design would cost $6, and you'll get three copies of your board.  Shipping by US Mail will be $2 extra. 

If you're part of the workshop (see below!), you'll receive your order at the December 21st DorkbotPDX general meeting.

=== How to submit your order ===
For now, just email your board designs to "pcb-order@denizen.org" as either an Eagle .brd or a set of Gerbers.

Include the number of copies you want in multiples of 3.

If you're making Gerbers from Eagle, please use this CAM job:
